neither sperm or egg have the capacity to become human <i>unless</i> they fuse together. They are half of a human being and will never grow to be human and are never human, but a foetus is human because it has the necessary prerequisites to be considered human.
<b>And then you must logically stop petitioning humans to follow your odd dogma, and spend that time demanding god do so, since in these states god, via nature, aborts far more humans than have ever even been in the fetal state, in all of human history.</b>
I'll certainly entertain this argument. There is a difference between us and God- we can't create one hair on a child's body or a foetus from literal nothing, but God can, and because he can, he can abort as many babies as he wants.
<b>Or if you are a reasonable being you could realize that the determining factor is self-awareness and not what that thing will someday perhaps become</b>
Because we can't communicate with a foetus it isn't self aware. That's rubbish. Just because you can't speak to it doesn't make it unaware of what is happening around it. It is aware enough to collect the necessary nutrients to keep living, growing and specializing cells it needs for independent living. Anything that can do this is a little self aware. By your argument, people in a vegetative state are 'not aware' but yet we still feel the obligation to stick IV fluids in there arms and keep them alive.

Fact: At the point of conception the fetus has no more self awareness than the sperm or the egg individually, nor does it 3 to 6 months after that point. After six months it may have the self-awareness of an insect. 
So my analogy is factually correct. 
But you are not basing your idea on facts, which is fine, I'm happy to address your concerns as well,
you are using potential. You believe that thing, upon conception is meant to be. 
You've said so and I will show you where, but let's not gloss over exactly what you believe because I find it is helpful for individuals, like yourself, who have an invested ideological incentive to thoughtlessly defend an indefensible position.
You believe, literally, that of the millions of sperm in each ejaculation, and of the 300,000 eggs a woman has in her body, that those very two were meant to meet at that very time. Keep in mind all of the billions of people in the world as well. You believe that it was preordained for those two people to meet at exactly that time, have exactly that egg ovulating, and exactly that one sperm would win the race. 
This is your belief, there was no free will, you did not choose, you were controlled by some divine power to make it just so regardless of the astronomical odds. That is the only thing that ""<b>it is already meant to become and be treated as a human being</b>"" can ever mean.
It is important to describe this exactly because people who say this rarely or never think of the true implications of it. There is no other implication for the statement ""<b>it is already meant to become and be treated as a human being.</b>"" To be true there necessarily <i>cannot</i> be free will at all or choice at all.
But okay, that is what you believe. 
If that is the case, then the person who aborts also has no free will.
This too is necessarily true because every action has a reaction, and if all potential was ""<b>meant to become</b>"" then at some point an abortion which was <i>not</i> ""<b>meant to be</b>"" would result in a different child than would have been born, who'd consequently have different DNA, who'd consequently make different kids than were meant to be, 
etc, etc, etc,
This is not outlandish or silly. It is the <i>only</i> conclusion to your theory of ""<b>meant to become</b>,"" the only one.
If you have free will then humans are random and you <i>have to</i> measure life by self-awareness because everything else is too random to apply. 
If you do not have free will than humans are not random, in which case you are correct, but at the very same time you have no right to deny another an abortion because that too <i>has to be</i> in order for your own theory to work.
Logically, you prove my point.","<b>Fact: At the point of conception the fetus has no more self awareness than the sperm or the egg individually, nor does it 3 to 6 months after that point. After six months it may have the self-awareness of an insect.</b>

Or if it were a different angle and a different sperm won the race I'd not exist. Or if they'd have never met. Or all of those scenarios for each of their parents, or each of those scenarios for each of their parent's parents, etc etc etc.
There are trillions upon trillions of scenarios in which I don't exist, someone else exists, several someone elses exist, none exist, etc. 
And in all instances none would know the difference, including myself.","<b>I could say no fertilized egg has the capacity to become a human unless it develops properly.</b>
Yeah and I am saying it is human because it has the necessary prerequisites to be human
<b>I could say it does not have the capacity to become a human if the woman's birth canal is not wide enough. </b>
Despite what you could say, the birth canal has nothing do with the child being human.
Besides we dont need birth canals when we can do C-sections.
<b>I could say it does not have the capacity to become a human via a million different scenarios, even after impregnation.</b>
You could and you stand beside one scenario, thats why we are having this conversation.
<b>So why is your arbitrary point of ""humanity"" correct?</b>
Yeah I'm sure its right. Let me ask you a question if it isn't human, what species is it.Is humanity now status that one obtains throughout achieving/having things that are either out of there reach/control. It reminds me of the racial comments the 'whites' used to pour out. Because Africans were black and wore practically no clothes they were subhuman- and now because a foetus doesn't have brain, it is also sub-human.
<b>I say it is not. I believe the point at which it should be treated with this integrity is the point at which it has feelings, self-awareness, consciousness.</b>
As far as I'm concerned a foetus is aware of its own existence because it is capable of organizing its cells and collecting the necessary nutrients for not only growth, but survival.
<b>Ah, so in your mind power has an inherent right to do with power what they please.</b>
Yes and no. It is not as if humanity is perfect, remember that most Gods in antiquity (yes its probably a gross generalization) only act this way when provoked. In all the historical cases I've read on still births or miscarriages where a God was involved, the soul of the unborn child gets repatriation after this dilemma. The personas of these Gods are not very bad- in fact they have all that power and answer to no one, so why give the soul of these babies heaven, or reincarnation or any form of repatriation to these children/parents. they have no obligation to and they still do it so they dont abuse there power like what you would like to believe.
<b>But those without power must be held to a higher standard of morality than those with power.</b>
No I am not holding human beings at a higher standard of morality- I do however think we lower our moral construct in order to find loopholes. This is why there is a yard stick for 'consciousness' when we cant even tell if someone is conscious or not when there in comatose. And I have a question- isn't to be conscious to be aware of ones surroundings? Are you aware during the first two years of life, during sleep, while under powerful anaesthesia? If you forfeit your consciousness, are you still human?
<b>By your logic then, if one is rich and powerful, and another is poor and has no power, that rich person should have more rights.</b>
They already do and are a determinant factor on whether the poor live or die, or if they get food, or money for an operation. What a grievance. And we have more power than a foetus and are the determinant factor on whether they live or die, or eat, or get to see the light of day, see a comparison?
<b>This is your logic, which is fine, religion is weird like that.</b>
In the three major world religions every God provides repatriation for those who are faithful, with a few exceptions.
<b>I believe if anything an all powerful being should be held to a higher standard of morality. If your god existed as you describe, this being should be despised in fact for abuse of that power.</b>
You probably didn't factor in the afterlife of the current day religions- In Hinduism, the baby is reincarnated as something else and Hindus are implored to treat animals with respect because there souls are human in essence. No harm done there i guess. In Christianity and Judaism, the one account of an abortion carried out by God ended up with child in heaven. That's better than Earth? So I'm guessing God was doing the baby a favour.
<b>But all of this is inconsequential to the subject of abortion because religion cannot be applied to legislation. It is unconstitutional and frankly stupid and backwards as you can plainly see simply by looking at nations who base law on religion presently and historically.</b>
If its inconsequential, then you shouldn't have brought it up.
<b>Your information is incorrect. We know when a foetus is somewhat conscious by the development of the brain, not by whether we can communicate, obviously.</b>
Yes and the development of the brain suggests further response to stimulus like heartbeat, movement in the stomach and response to pain or noise, which is a form of communication.
<b>Otherwise if doctors determine there is no hope for rehabilitation taking these people off of life support is in no way immoral.</b>
Doctors can't truly determine if someone will come out of a vegetative state and regain consciousness. However with a foetus they know that baby will receive a state of conscious in a few months. If a person in comatose would have woken up in a week, or a month, or three months is it morally just to take that person off life support? Doctors remove people off life support only because of lack of surety and foetus is not a case of lack of surety. 
<b>Your analogy is incorrect because that person has a developed brain which is capable of conscious, perhaps depending on level of vegetation. A foetus is not in any way capable of this. These parts of the brain do not yet exist.</b>
Yeah and the computer that is shut down with no way of communicating with the user and no clear signs of reboot is just as good as a brand new computer with its parts being assembled. Better yet, the second one has more value.
<b>Or if my mother would have had sex with my dad two days earlier or two days later it would have been a different batch of sperm and I'd not exist. Or if it were a different angle and a different sperm won the race I'd not exist. Or if they'd have never met. Or all of those scenarios for each of their parents, or each of those scenarios for each of their parent's parents, etc etc etc.</b>
You went way too much back in time. The determinant factor in your existence was already placed as a foundation- you were a foetus. You can't argue against that. Yes there were other factors that could stop you from <b>existing</b>, but you do realize that you had to go behind the point of conception to validate your point point of non-existence.

Pro-choice is not ""forcing"" anything. You don't have to get an abortion. More power to you. You are the one who wishes to force your view on others.

If that point is not magic than there is no reason that thing should be treated special. The only measure left is self-awareness and feeling. Therefore abortion to the point it is currently legal is more than ample to make sure nothing is harmed.

<b>And who cares about 'holy' or 'pre-ordained' or 'divine'- you are blaming a living being and prosecuting for something out of its control. That is such an injustice. </b>
It's not an injustice. That living thing has no feeling. Abortion is no more unjust than stepping on a bug or spraying a lawn with weed killer. That thing has no more feeling than the bug or the weeds.
<b>And you are not/ shouldn't be the final decider on whether a foetus isn't human or not- you are not the one that is entitled to handing out humanity as if it were some kind of gift.</b>
Neither are you. I can defend the position that something which is not self-aware and which has no feeling and which has not developed a functioning brain should not be treated the same as one which has those things. 
Pro-choice is not ""forcing"" anything. You don't have to get an abortion. More power to you. You are the one who wishes to force your view on others. 
<b>THe point of conception isn't magic- as what the debate says the foetus is human. And if it isn't human enlighten me as to what species it is, because it can't not have a classification.</b>
If that point is not magic than there is no reason that thing should be treated special. The only measure left is self-awareness and feeling. Therefore abortion to the point it is currently legal is more than ample to make sure nothing is harmed.
<b>I won't because I would be killing someone for something out of it's control.</b>
No, you won't because you mistakenly believe something which is not a person is a person. Which is your right and no one cares if you do that. The problem is when you demand that others take your view on this matter. Your view is provably wrong, therefore no one should be forced to follow your view.
<b>And anyone who doesn't consider the foetus to be human only does that so they can kill it whenever it becomes an inconvenience to them.</b>
Your ideal of when and how one comes to the decision to abort is childish and simple. You do not know what that person is thinking at all. And it does not matter because you are not them and should not be allowed to legislate their decision based on your superstitious beliefs.","Sorry about being 41 days late, regional exams and all.

You misinterpreted what i said. i was saying that you don't consider the fetus a child or human, which is just me covering anything that i believed would have otherwise been unclear.
<b>It's not an injustice. That living thing has no feeling. Abortion is no more unjust than stepping on a bug or spraying a lawn with weed killer. That thing has no more feeling than the bug or the weeds.</b>
Bugs do have feelings: spray a bug with Raid and you can see by the response that PETA should probably start campaigning against bug spray. And all living things can feel to an extent, but how much does a foetus need to feel to be considered human? That's the question i have to you.
<b>Neither are you. I can defend the position that something which is not self-aware and which has no feeling and which has not developed a functioning brain should not be treated the same as one which has those things.

So i guess by this logic then you treat all things without any respect- because you're an atheist and well- i think you see where i am going from here. And the only measure need not be self awareness, honestly once something is living it has some form of self awareness.
<b>No, you won't because you mistakenly believe something which is not a person is a person. Which is your right and no one cares if you do that.

-Socrates","<b>Is it conciousness? If so, then are mentally illed, or people in coma considered as an animal? Is it physical structure? If so, then how do you explain bedridden people and senior citizens?</b>
Bedridden people and senior citizens are self aware. 
If you are trying in your simple way to say that ""if it is justifiable to abort a fetus for the reason it is not self-aware, then you would need to feel the same about one in a coma is is not self-aware"" 
You'd at least have a sensible argument, but it is still not the same because that person has the structure for self-awareness, and in most cases is to some degree conscious, even in a deep coma, and a fetus is missing the parts which would make this possible. So it is not the same in that way. 
But that is also ignoring the fact that we unplug people all of the time, and we do this based on the will of the individual if they left a will, and if not, it is the will of the family.
So applying your exact example to abortion, it would be the case where it was the will of the mother to ""unplug"" the one in a coma, if you are making that comparison.
Again though, it is not the same. In a coma you have the stuff that makes consciousness possible, a fetus does not have this.
<b>-The legallity of an action depends upon culture of the state. But there is only one rule for morality And that rule is to be followed by every citizen.</b>
Exactly. Which is why it is immoral for you to try to force your will on others. I'm glad you are now pro-choice.

<b>It was never pointless to stand up for something that is right. But it is pointless to stand up for self centered reasonings</b>
Exactly. It is important we continue to stand up for women's right to choose because the alternative is more dead women and not a single extra fetus being born, and since that fetus has no feelings it is definitely the choice of the woman. It feels good to stand up for what's right. It's important these anti-abortion crazies aren't ever allowed to force their will on people again.

neither sperm or egg have the capacity to become human <i>unless</i> they fuse together. They are half of a human being and will never grow to be human and are never human, but a foetus is human because it has the necessary prerequisites to be considered human.
<b>And then you must logically stop petitioning humans to follow your odd dogma, and spend that time demanding god do so, since in these states god, via nature, aborts far more humans than have ever even been in the fetal state, in all of human history.</b>
I'll certainly entertain this argument. There is a difference between us and God- we can't create one hair on a child's body or a foetus from literal nothing, but God can, and because he can, he can abort as many babies as he wants.
<b>Or if you are a reasonable being you could realize that the determining factor is self-awareness and not what that thing will someday perhaps become</b>
Because we can't communicate with a foetus it isn't self aware. That's rubbish. Just because you can't speak to it doesn't make it unaware of what is happening around it. It is aware enough to collect the necessary nutrients to keep living, growing and specializing cells it needs for independent living. Anything that can do this is a little self aware. By your argument, people in a vegetative state are 'not aware' but yet we still feel the obligation to stick IV fluids in there arms and keep them alive.

A sperm is just the part of a man, an egg cell is the part of a woman. Losing them is just the same as losing blood.
But once they became together as one and fertilized to create a fetus, it is already meant to become and be treated as a human being. Funny how you guys give humanitary rights to animals but not among the humans who holds the future generation.
The carelessness of the parents is something that the baby is not meant to pay with their life. And Legal isn't always Moral","<b>But once they became together as one and fertilized to create a fetus, it is already meant to become and be treated as a human being.</b>
Fact: At the point of conception the fetus has no more self awareness than the sperm or the egg individually, nor does it 3 to 6 months after that point. After six months it may have the self-awareness of an insect. 
So my analogy is factually correct. 
But you are not basing your idea on facts, which is fine, I'm happy to address your concerns as well,
you are using potential. You believe that thing, upon conception is meant to be. 
You've said so and I will show you where, but let's not gloss over exactly what you believe because I find it is helpful for individuals, like yourself, who have an invested ideological incentive to thoughtlessly defend an indefensible position.
You believe, literally, that of the millions of sperm in each ejaculation, and of the 300,000 eggs a woman has in her body, that those very two were meant to meet at that very time. Keep in mind all of the billions of people in the world as well. You believe that it was preordained for those two people to meet at exactly that time, have exactly that egg ovulating, and exactly that one sperm would win the race. 
This is your belief, there was no free will, you did not choose, you were controlled by some divine power to make it just so regardless of the astronomical odds. That is the only thing that ""<b>it is already meant to become and be treated as a human being</b>"" can ever mean.
It is important to describe this exactly because people who say this rarely or never think of the true implications of it. There is no other implication for the statement ""<b>it is already meant to become and be treated as a human being.</b>"" To be true there necessarily <i>cannot</i> be free will at all or choice at all.
But okay, that is what you believe. 
If that is the case, then the person who aborts also has no free will.
This too is necessarily true because every action has a reaction, and if all potential was ""<b>meant to become</b>"" then at some point an abortion which was <i>not</i> ""<b>meant to be</b>"" would result in a different child than would have been born, who'd consequently have different DNA, who'd consequently make different kids than were meant to be, 
etc, etc, etc,
This is not outlandish or silly. It is the <i>only</i> conclusion to your theory of ""<b>meant to become</b>,"" the only one.
If you have free will then humans are random and you <i>have to</i> measure life by self-awareness because everything else is too random to apply. 
If you do not have free will than humans are not random, in which case you are correct, but at the very same time you have no right to deny another an abortion because that too <i>has to be</i> in order for your own theory to work.

<b>""And if there is not self-awareness, consciousness, or feeling involved for that thing in question, the foetus, then you have no right to force your belief about what is ""moral"" onto another.""</b>
-The legallity of an action depends upon culture of the state. But there is only <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule'>one rule for morality</a> And that rule is to be followed by every citizen.
<b>Easy, I value life which is conscious and self aware, not random clusters of cells my imagination deems a person. That thing has no feelings, no conscious. If you've ever eaten meet then you've harmed a living thing more than any person who has had an abortion.</b>
- History has always made up laws to pretend that a human being is not a human being. They create lies to mask their immorality and separate themselves from their own brothers and fill in the selfish philosophy that they wanted.
Once, it was pointed at small tribes by the empires. Then by the white man to the black man. Now, a mother to her child.
Is that what you wanted me to see?
<b>Because nothing is hurt and nothing is lost.</b>
- <i>sigh</i> This is just stupid. A person who does not have a sense of value for morality cannot be disputed nor supported.
<b>1. It's not a child. It's a cluster of cells with no feelings or conscious.
2. No, I said, clearly, laws against abortion don't work anyway, even if there were a reason for them, which there is not. You than said ""I DON'T CARE BABIES AND TEDDY BEARS ERRR AND ITS MEANY HEAD TIME SO DO IT ANYWAY"" and I said that it does not make sense to do something which does not work, and which in reality causes more death than saves ""lives.""</b>
- 1. Again with the excuses, can we skip this one? I dont like repeating a statement if it has not originality
2. Abortion was legalized in 1973. And with abortion allowed, everyone believed that the unwanted children and the number of child abuse decrease, right?
<a href='http://www.abortionfacts.com/reardon/abortion-trauma-and-child-abuse'>WRONG</a>
The legalization of abortion has not only increased crime, it also devalued human life and created a society corrupted of its morals (you can do more research if you want).
It was never pointless to stand up for something that is right. But it is pointless to stand up for self centered reasonings

-Socrates","<b>Is it conciousness? If so, then are mentally illed, or people in coma considered as an animal? Is it physical structure? If so, then how do you explain bedridden people and senior citizens?</b>
Bedridden people and senior citizens are self aware. 
If you are trying in your simple way to say that ""if it is justifiable to abort a fetus for the reason it is not self-aware, then you would need to feel the same about one in a coma is is not self-aware"" 
You'd at least have a sensible argument, but it is still not the same because that person has the structure for self-awareness, and in most cases is to some degree conscious, even in a deep coma, and a fetus is missing the parts which would make this possible. So it is not the same in that way. 
But that is also ignoring the fact that we unplug people all of the time, and we do this based on the will of the individual if they left a will, and if not, it is the will of the family.
So applying your exact example to abortion, it would be the case where it was the will of the mother to ""unplug"" the one in a coma, if you are making that comparison.
Again though, it is not the same. In a coma you have the stuff that makes consciousness possible, a fetus does not have this.
<b>-The legallity of an action depends upon culture of the state. But there is only one rule for morality And that rule is to be followed by every citizen.</b>
Exactly. Which is why it is immoral for you to try to force your will on others. I'm glad you are now pro-choice.

<b>- 1. Again with the excuses, can we skip this one? I dont like repeating a statement if it has not originality</b>
Skip what? That the fetus has no feelings or conscious? That's the entire premise. It cannot be skipped. It is the central issue, as you know, you now being pro-choice as you've stated.
<b>2. Abortion was legalized in 1973. And with abortion allowed, everyone believed that the unwanted children and the number of child abuse decrease, right?</b>

So annoying and dumb. 
I'm glad you at least realize that has nothing to do with why abortion was made legal. And that you also realize that link you sent is a religious looney propoganda piece with 0 basis in reality. It's nice to have someone who gets it on one of these debates.
<b>The legalization of abortion has not only increased crime, it also devalued human life and created a society corrupted of its morals (you can do more research if you want).</b>
lol, I know, that's just the kind of red herring a pro-life person would throw out then not back up with facts. Because they are totally wrong about it! Since there is absolutely no correlation. Great job anticipating a dumb argument someone might make. 
<b>It was never pointless to stand up for something that is right. But it is pointless to stand up for self centered reasonings</b>
Exactly. It is important we continue to stand up for women's right to choose because the alternative is more dead women and not a single extra fetus being born, and since that fetus has no feelings it is definitely the choice of the woman. It feels good to stand up for what's right. It's important these anti-abortion crazies aren't ever allowed to force their will on people again.

Where did I say they were? Whatever ""nostic"" label you use refers to the type of claim of knowledge one makes. Agnosticism in a arguement over gods existence lends itself to atheism for reasons that should be quite obvious. 
<b>Agnosticism is not a form of atheism. Even if you were to say someone was an agnostic atheist the argument still stands firm.</b>
An agnostic athiest is an athiest that takes an agnostic position on god's existence, which is to say they don't assert to know. Think of the label like ""Liberal"" democrat or ""social"" conservative. The label serves as a clarification of the particular position you hold. And I don't see how the argument stands in light of the agnostic or even the ignostic athiest.
<b>So in other words, what you call an agnostic atheist believe in the non existence of God while a gnostic atheist proves God to be not real to himself. At the end of the day these are still active positions of belief. So you do believe in something</b>
I have already presented the angnostic model of atheism. They don't assert the existence nor non-existence of a diety. It is no a position of belief, it is the withholdal of judgement on the issue. The gnostic athiest may well fall into this straw man, but his agnostic and ignostic conterparts quite clearly don't.
<b>Idiocy/acting differently does not make them any less examples.</b>
It kinda does in this context, where you were addressing the causal link between behavior and disregard for gravity. If the example doesn't use his cognitive capacity , how can he be indicative of any trend deduction of a rational populace?

Both sides of the coin, ""I do not believe that God exists"" and ""I do not believe that God does not exist"", would be so for someone; however, simply because one has not been convinced of X does not mean that they do not intrinsically hold to X (know or being convinced of something, and believe should not be equivocated here). Believe is simply the undertaking of a variable, while everyone undertakes one variable or the other, whether positive of negative: God exists or God does not exist. Atheism, therefore, negates the belief, which negates the positive position being believed, which means that one intrinsically must believe the other one: ""I believe that God does not exist"".
God either exists or does not exist; there is no in-between. One either believes that God exists or believes that God does not exist, whether that belief is backed up with evidence or not, which means regardless of whether one is actively or passively holding to the opinion. Therefore, if one does not believe X, then one is saying that they do not believe the positive position of X.

No, but apatheism specifically is a lack of belief brought about by lack if care for addressing the question.

A third meaning isn't added, there are 2 possible implications to the statement ""I am not running fast"".

They describe the lack of running. Lack of running neccessarly means lack of running fast.

Apathy- without care
Atheism- without belief in a diety
Apatheism- describes atheism with the specific foundation of not caring about the question of theistic propositions.

50,./to_process\debate.show.A_proper_debate_for_the_existence_of_God_lj.xml,A proper debate for the existence of God,"This is a copy and paste argument I wrote quitesome time ago, it represents a creator God but not neccesarily an involved one.
(This is a response to an argument made by someone that God is not the creator of the universe, due to the Omniverse theory)
This particular topic was one which I had a really hard time with when I was not a believer as I could not find any other logical solution to this very issue, and as such I shall now expand upon that initial thought process which is more or less a more wordy form of the Cosmological argument.
Now to begin with we must first look at the issue of a single universe (ours). Now the idea is that there was no such thing as time before the big bang which of course makes sense, just as one could say that there are no timings before a race because the stopwatch has not been started yet. Now the issue I have with this is the fact that matter is a physical element and is thus subject to time and it would also need some method of creation, namely forces. So what we get is a situation where time is dependant on the matter to begin and vice versa. Then we also have the forces which are dependant themselves on matter to exist and the matter would need the extreme forces to exist (assuming that is how they are created according to the theory). So if we look at the analogy of the race we have a three way paradox in that the stopwatch cannot begin until all of the swimmers are at the blocks and the swimmers cannot get to the blocks because (in this case) there is no existence before the stopwatch begins. On top of this the starter’s gun cannot fire until all of the swimmers are at the blocks and at the ready and likewise the swimmers cannot start the race until the starters gun has fired. So what this means is that the swimmers would all have to be put into their positions all at the exact same time that the starter’s gun and the stopwatch go off. These both in terms of the analogy and reality are completely impossible.
There is however a theory known as the “pop” theory which more or less means that matter can pop into being from nothing aka has no cause. This is impossible on both logical and rational levels because matter, as a physical element, must have a cause. It would be like saying a table has no cause which is clearly nonsensical as it must be made before it can be a table. However on top of this there is no evidence to show that matter just appears out of nowhere. Also if matter just pops into existence without a cause then in reality there should be nothing that governs how or in what quantity it comes into being. Assuming this, then the moment the universe began it should have instantly filled up with new matter and thus the universe should be one infinite block of compact matter with no room for anti-matter etc. Now as a final point if pop theory is indeed true then if a physical element can pop into existence without cause then it would be likewise possible for a non-physical being to be uncaused.
Now what we call the universe is merely the perimeter with which matter is pushing it out, just as a balloon grows as the air molecules push against the sides of the balloon. We must assume that as matter does not exist outside of these universal “bubbles” that space is indeed a necessary property with which to create matter. In terms of our analogy space would be the pool. This adds another element to the issue in that the swimmers would need to be in the water already, but the pool needs to be filled with water by the swimmers. However the swimmers cannot fill the pool as time does not exist. So in other words they would need to fill the pool, be at the blocks and start the race all at the exact same time as the stopwatch is started and the starter’s gun goes off. If this point is argued against by saying that space is not dependant upon matter’s existence then the concept of an “Expanding universe” is illogical as the universe would already be infinite. As well as this the idea of an omniverse would also be impossible as it would all be one universe, just spaced apart like our galaxies are. 
Now to deal with the Omniverse theory itself. The basic idea is that the Omniverse is an infinite expanse of universes that can give birth to new universes. This is based on the idea of two universes “touching” each other, the force of which would initiate a big bang. Now the issue with this is that a universe cannot touch another universe if that other universe does not exist. As mentioned earlier the universe is dependant on the matter to exist and so on so forth. This means that a separate universe could not start another universe as there is no other universe to be started. In terms of the analogy think of the separate universe as being a helper who pushes you off of the blocks as you start to give you extra force, however they cannot push you off until the pool is filled. 
The only possibility then is if the other universe starts off another universe by fulfilling all of these factors meaning that it would have to split off from the main universe much like bacteria. The issue with this is that this is not a violent process and would not initiate a big bang as the matter is already within the space that has separated. But assuming that it did create a big bang then that particular universe would have to be immensely huge to be able to start a new universe with as much matter as ours. Another issue with this however is the problem that if it can split off then so should ours, and we should be creating more and more universes just as it would, meaning that eventually our universe would have petered out into nothing and we would essentially have in the end an omniverse full of single atoms. 
However the only way the Omniverse theory could be feasible as a creator is if it is infinite. Now this is impossible as matter can degenerate which means that on an infinite scale the omniverse should have either expanded out and eventually dissipated into nothingness or fallen back in upon itself due to gravitational pull and been destroyed (assuming there is gravitational pull between them which there shouldn’t be because the forces would be limited to the matter which are limited to the universe, just as a starter’s gun cannot be used to start a race the next town over). 
So as a result of the above statements we must conclude that there was indeed time before the big bang, just in another universe or dimension. Now these times themselves are dependant on the times of their creator universe, resulting in an infinite regression. However the Omniverse cannot be infinite due to the aforementioned points so eventually there must be a point of origin. This point of origin is in the exact same position as our universe, just several steps back and with nothing to appeal to.
This leaves us with only one rational option. That is that there is another separate universe/dimension that is not physical in nature (heaven) which was created by an uncaused entity that is also not physical in nature (God). This uncaused entity would have to be immensely powerful (Omnipotent) and not subject to physical laws such as time (Omnipresent). This being would thus be able to create space and matter at exactly the same time using its immense power (forces) and Omnipresence which in turn would start the universe.","<b> Now to begin with we must first look at the issue of a single universe (ours). Now the idea is that there was no such thing as time before the big bang which of course makes sense, just as one could say that there are no timings before a race because the stopwatch has not been started yet.</b>
Actually I have to admit the Big Bang might not have necessarily been the origin of time, nor the origin of existence. The origin of the universe? Yes, in a similiar sense that the origin of a rock was natural force, referring to the existence of its form rather than the existence of all the parts that made it. Before the big bang everything did exist as a singularity (which may mean time Still existed). The analogy is wrong because with the race time didn't literally start when the race did, the particular measurement of time did, the analogy comparing the race with the universe would merely show how the formation of the universe has a time span but not beginning of time itself. I don't know if this is going to help or hurt my case but I don't think the big bang was the beginning of time necessarily. There is also the cycle theory where we are going through a cycle of crunches and bangs. The big crunch theory is contained inside this theory, the big crunch theory would be... Think of the big bang, but backwards call this the normal flow of time at the end of time... Basically the universe becoming a singularity again. 
<b> Now the issue I have with this is the fact that matter is a physical element and is thus subject to time and it would also need some method of creation, namely forces.

That is because the big bang wasn't the beginning of time, merely the beginning of the universe's formation lifespan. Just like with the race, your analogy is flawed.

I don't know the credibility of that theory, it doesn't sound very credible. I don't necessarily think all matter existed eternally, but it makes just as much sense as a God does.

Well this is also based on your assumption of time being finite, being a conclusion of that analogy that I have argued is flawed. Also the universe's expansion (and I could be wrong) is merely meaning that all the matter, stars, galaxies, etc are moving outward into space. As well as the omniverse, we don't know if an omniverse exists, but maybe they could be different realms sort of idea. Maybe exist in different dimensions that never overlap.... Like planes.

First of all, I want you to be aware of my position concerning the debate of the theory of evolution. There are many evidences of many things in life. And that which one person infers as evidence of one thing is not necessarily and universally evidence of the same unto another person. Moreover, that which you have written of as evidence of evolution I find to be unconvincing. And likewise that, which I have written of I perceive is also unconvincing unto you. I am not interested in dissuading your position in regards to your conclusions. I am more interested in challenging what I think is axiomatic concerning the progenitors of the members of a species.
Axiom: a conclusion that needs no proof because its truth is obvious. (As used in Logic)
My axiom, simplified, is that a progenitor propagates progeny of its own species. Or one could also say that each species propagates its own species.
The definitions of the terms of my propositional axiom do not connote meanings that are specially defined. Example: Species A begets offspring of Species A. Man is born of man. Oranges are the fruit of Orange trees, etc.
What is your axiom? 
Our debate has now effectively been reduced to two conclusions; one is yours and the other mine. We can actually spare one another thousands of words of explanations by simply determining the root cause of our disagreement, so called. Take for example the following argument.
My argument: A is B, and B is D, therefore A is D. 
Your argument: A is not B, B is not D, and therfore A is not D. 
We can agree or disagree based upon the axiom. And the debate logically ends or begins thereby.
Let’s debate the axioms.","I would argue that the simplification of your axiom is at the root cause of the misunderstanding.
The label ""species"" is a completely arbritrary method of categorisation. Whilst a progenitor will of course immediately produce the same species, its offspring will not be genetically identical, and its the accumulation of these genetic differences that eventually cause a new species. I will try to be as simple and to the point with my initial argument as possible, as I feel your intepretation of my argument is entirely incorrect.
Let us label a progenitor at any stage of the evolutionary line as N. The offspring of a progenitor will be N+1. We can say both N is N+1 and N is not N+1 depending on our criteria of equality, in this debate the criteria being either the same species or genetically identical respectively. Whilst a parent and their offspring are the same species (N is N+1) they are NOT genetically identical (N is not N+1). I assume that you don't disagree with this point, but if you do than please say so. 
My argument (I will not call it an axiom), also simplified, is that an accumulation of genetic differences caused by random mutations means that whilst N is N+1 (using your equality criteria), it does not self evidently lead to the fact that N is N+<i>x</i> (<i>x</i> being any number of generations along the evolutionary tree), and that the chances of N not being N+<i>x</i> increases in probability the higher the value of <i>x</i> is.
Because the definition of a species is arbritrarily defined (simplistically) as a group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring, and as genetics provides the mechanisms for performing this functionality, it is not illogical to state that my criteria for equality has a direct baring on how your criteria for equality is measured. As in all cases my criteria for equality means that N is not N+1, and as the accumulation of my criteria has a direct effect on how your criteria is measured, it lends that this can lead to N is not N+<i>x</i>.
I did not call my argument an axiom as, according to your definition, it is something that requires no proof. I have clearly shown an alternative possibilty to your argument (as you have done to mine), therefore your axiom is not self evident and you are required to show evidence to back it up. I too must also bring evidence to the table to back up my argument. I'm afraid this will not be as simple for you as you first thought, as the debate does not logically end or begin based upon self evident axioms, but by differing arguments backed up by evidence. We've both stated our positions (neither or which are self evident, but both of which are possiblities), now let's debate both the arguments raised <b>and</b> the evidence to support those arguments.
So, if you wish to continue debating this, here is a bullet pointed list of some of the points that I will be making to back up my argument. You may rebute them as you see fit.
1. A parent and their child are never genetically identical.
2. Genetic mutations occur.
3. Some of these genetic mutations are beneficial to the organism.
4. As the definition of species is arbritrary, there is no natural force that limits genetic mutations to only those that would not affect the reproductive processes of an organism.
5. An accumulation of mutations that affect reproductive processes would eventually lead to an N+<i>x</i> that could not produce fertile offspring with N.
I feel I've adequately made my point, and shown your intitial axiom to not be as self evident as it would initial appear. I hope you too see that we will need to provide evidence to back up our positions (as neither is self evident). I look forward to a good debate.",4.0

Do you realise that most abortions (over ninety percent) occur before the foetus even has brain tissue? Think about that for a moment. Everything that makes us what we are comes from our brain, but what's aborted in the vast majority of cases has NO brain. In many cases what's aborted is a microscopic bit of cells.

Dumpster babies have a level of self-awareness, as noted by their ability to respond to stimuli, that they have a nervous system, and that they have a memory. Sleeping babies are the same.
I personally approve of euthanasia for the severely mentally handicapped, and people who are in comas long enough that their recovery is nonexistent. Provided that the mentally handicapped are violent, and/or completely unable to function.
But this is all besides the point: laws are never consistent in their philosophy.
<b>which would be the same argument given stating that a fetus will eventually develop a brain and demonstrate sapience</b>
We don't base laws on the potential future ramifications of a choice. This is why disposing of a used condom isn't considered abortion, for example.

This is because sapience comes from the brain. If a foetus has none, it cannot be sapient. Sapience in this discussion is an umbrella word for independent thought, some level of consciousness, an ability to make decisions and so on.
We don't apply it to organisms with developed brains because those organisms are already capable of individuality. At this point, losing consciousness doesn't disqualify the individuality, unless the organism has transitioned into a state where they can not recover their consciousness, such as in a coma.

This is why abortion is made available. In those cases where a woman becomes pregnant, she can abort before the foetus is even a person, before it has a brain. By illegalising abortion, you remove a woman's right to abort the process that creates a human life, you force her to either have an illegal abortion, or to accept that pregnancy automatically leads to a human being born.
<b>In such a case we should just say we allow abortion because it suits us, not that it is allowed because of some philosophical system or principled decision.</b>

<b>I'll tell you this, if you find the answers for yourself... you'll not only see my point is valid but you will have a whole new appreciation for the applicability of the word in various situations.</b>
I'm well aware of how to use words in different situations. 'The caravan arrived at the city unmolested,' for example, means the caravan arrived undisturbed, not arrived un-sexually abused. 'The Rape of Nanking' doesn't refer to anyone actually physically inserting their penis into a city against the will of the city, it's just a play on words to illustrate the horror and depravity of what happened in Nanking. 
We can use words like this because it gets the point across and people still get what we mean when we talk like that. However, if you want to get extremely literal about this practice, you start to destroy the point of language by making everything too vague and ambiguous to be of any practical use. 
For example, one of the words used to define ""rape"" is ""violate."" If we consider every time anyone violates anything - a trespassing law, the trust of their friends, a contract, etc - legally the exact same thing as rape, our prisons would literally be packed to the ceiling with convicts. If you tried to claim a baby crying in a restaurant was molesting you because he was annoying you, technically, according to your subjective definition of the word, you're correct; you'd also look like a damn fool and nobody from the Supreme Court on up would take you seriously. 
The problem is you're working language backwards. Most people try to find a word that most clearly and accurately describes what they are trying to say. You're doing the exact opposite, finding words that can just barely by some stretch of the imagination be made to work in certain, specific circumstances.

<i>1 Interfere with the normal arrangement or functioning of.
2 Destroy the sleep or relaxation of.</i>
It fits perfectly. It doesn't need to be altered or bent, no part needs to be ignored or omitted for the entire definition of the word to seamlessly apply to the situations you are talking about. 
And if you had said ""abortions are a form of disturbing things"" nobody would be arguing with you.
But you went out of your way to choose a word with an overtly sexual definition, like rape. I can only assume this was to be inflammatory, which is why I argue with you now.

For example, <i>""the whole land (erets) of Ethiopia""</i> or <i>""the whole land (erets) of Havilah.""</i> If you go to <a href='http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?page=2&strongs;=H776#lexResults'>this site</a> and scroll down to the section titled ""Concordance Results using KJV"" it shows all the verses where the word <i>erets</i> is used. 
<b>ma‛al translated means upward.</b>
Yes, the verse I quoted actually has the word upward in it so I'm not sure what point you're trying to make with that.
<b>The word there is har which can mean hill</b>
The word <i>har</i> occurs 18 times in Genesis. 17 out of those 18 are translated <i>mountain</i> or <i>mount</i>. The one verse that is translated <i>hill</i> makes sense as <i>hill</i> because of the context. Here is the verse along with the one right after it that translates the same word as <i>mountain</i>. 
Genesis 7:
<i>19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills (har), that were under the whole heaven, were covered . 
20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail ; and the mountains (har) were covered.</i>
So if we translated <i>har</i> in verse 19 as <i>mountains</i> it would be redundant because of verse 20, and if we translate <i>har</i> in verse 20 as <i>hills</i> it would also make those verses redundant, which is why they translated the first one <i>hill</i> and the second one <i>mountain</i>. Plus the one in verse 19 is prefixed by the word ""<i>high</i>"", and saying <i>""high mountain""</i> would also be redundant because all mountains are high. The passage just describes the rising waters, first covering the high hills and then rising over the mountains.

The description of the flood makes it very clear that it was meant to be global by the excessive usage of phrases like ""all the people on earth"", ""end to all people"", ""destroy all life under the heaven"", ""every creature that has the breath of life in it"", ""Everything on earth will perish"", ""all life"", and ""destroy the earth."" I don't know how the author could make it any more clear. Think about it, if the author wanted to convey a global flood what more could he say other than all that? 
Another thing to consider is gods promise, ""Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.” If the flood was only a local flood then he has broken his promise many times because there are been many very large local floods.
I think you're grasping at straws trying to find some way to make the flood story about a local flood. Am I correct in assuming it's because you've discovered all the evidence that proves that there was no global flood and you're trying to find a way to make the flood story fit this evidence?",4.0

The word <i>tebel</i> isn't used even once in Genesis, so clearly the author doesn't use that word. However he uses <i>erets</i> to describe the earth over and over and over again. Read these verses in Genesis and tell me you think that the word <i>earth</i> in all of those should really be <i>land</i>. <a href='http://biblesuite.com/hebrew/strongs_776.htm'>http://biblesuite.com/hebrew/strongs_776.htm </a>
Was genesis 1:1 really supposed to say ""In the beginning God created the heaven and the land.""
You're picking one verse, taking it to its literal extreme and ignoring the complete context of the story and the book of Genesis as a whole.
Do you think all those passages I quoted you were translated incorrectly?
""all the people on earth"" should be ""all the people in the area""
""end to all people"" should be ""end to all people in the general vicinity""
""destroy all life under the heaven"" should be ""destroy all life in this area""
""every creature that has the breath of life in it"" should be ""every creature in the area that has breath of life in it""
""Everything on earth will perish"" should be ""everything around here will perish""
""all life"" should be ""all life around here, which is actually a very small amount of life on earth""
""destroy the earth."" should be ""destroy the area around here""
Do you see just how much you have to alter the story to fit a local flood?
For the sake of argument let's assume it was a local flood. Would you then agree that god lied when he promised he wouldn't flood the ""land"" again?
Would you also agree that nearly every verse in the story was translated incorrectly?","<b>You're picking one verse, taking it to its literal extreme and ignoring the complete context of the story and the book of Genesis as a whole.</b>
That is exactly what young earth creationist are doing since it would contradict psalm 104:9.
Also the flood account it appears to be from Noah's perspective also so that could be it. 
Also since it doesn't talk about mountain location it was probably refers to hills that the person (Noah) could see.

This argument actually almost stands. 
The difference stands first in the “effects”. If the <i>variation of personality</i> negatively impacts the person in his/her everyday life, then the <i>variation of personality</i> may be upgraded to a syndrome.

The question of <i>proving the existence</i> is actually an interesting one.
 As side question to you: what sort of proof would you expect to demonstrate the existence of intangible things such “a thought”, “jealousy”, ”learning process”?
There are several approaches that can be used. We can use observations, deductions, analysis...
One can say “ if I can see it ,then it exists”. We know this can’t always constitute a proof (for example, a mirage). 
One can say “if I can’t touch it or measure it, it does not exists”. Then, how do we prove the existence of intangible things like “charisma” and human emotions?
These things do exist (at least the vast majority of us human agree that they do). Yet the only real way that their existence is demonstrated is through their “tangible” effects, through analysis, statistics, deduction.
In fact, this is the way scientific discovery is made. The proof is reasonably achieved through the process of observing the effects, noting the correlations, the similarities, gathering statistics, note the negative impacts etc…
<b>If we can't prove the existence of a syndrome, we cannot reasonably assume that any particular trait is an effect of that syndrome.</b>
No, we cannot.
However, if we can note a series of abnormal behaviors in an individual, we can prove the existence of a syndrome.","<b> If the variation of personality negatively impacts the person in his/her everyday life, then the variation of personality may be upgraded to a syndrome.</b>
The problem with this notion is that nobody's personality is such as entirely benefits them. I, for example, have an unmercifully short temper. Thus your definition would, again, label everybody a sufferer of some syndrome or other.
<b>The second part is about the control over the said variation. The person with the variation of personality is not able to control his variation of personality to successfully cope with every day life.</b>
Case example: homosexuality. Not a syndrome, uncontrollable, and in many cases has been detrimental to the person in question's wellbeing.

I find it very odd that learning always comes into this. perhaps it is the result of the recent societal emphasis on education, but I don't think that is an appropriate measure of whether one is suffering from a syndrome or not. Some people simply do not fit into academic environments, and to say that every human should is rather strange, as widespread attendance is a relatively recent phenomenon. 
Persons who are identified as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are usually old enough to speak. If they can learn a language through osmosis, they clearly have the ability to <i>actually</i> learn, so the variable is probably environment. 
As an analogy, consider people who are remarkably bright, but cannot abide the tedium of physical labour. As far as I am aware, there is no proposed syndrome to explain an inability to perform repetitive, physically difficult tasks with enthusiasm and full attention, so why is there one explaining an inability to do so with academic tasks? 
<b>Homosexuality is not harmful to the person’s wellbeing. Society is making it difficult for homosexuals to live peacefully.</b>
In both cases, the harm is external, the result of behaviour and attitude.
<b>What definition of intangible are you referring to?</b>
Things with no physical manifestation, either in matter or energy; something with no observable effects.
<b>The fact that the universe exists cannot be used for a proof of God but on the other hand the gathering of a certain number of scientific experiments, measurements, observations, will bring a reasonable amount of proof that the Universe does exist</b>
I think you missed the point, sir. Essentially, a trait cannot be used as evidence of a syndrome. The analogy simply meant that an effect does not directly prove any particular explanation of the cause. 
<b>There is a point when the behavior is not normal; it then qualifies as a disorder.</b>
That is a dubious definition. We must remember that we are labelling a particular behavioural set as a medical illness, which is an inference supported by absolutely no medical science whatsoever. Nobody has yet measured any chemical imbalance of the brain which would result in this behaviour, and yet it is purported to be a neurobiological condition.
Between six and seven million children in the United States alone receive methylphenidate or some other amphetamine every day, often <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uiL4wmDbo0&feature;=related'>with terrible side effects</a>. 
<b>What about the people whose paranoid moments are extreme to a point that it controls their lives?</b>
Then they clearly have a problem, but it is a psychological one, <a href='http://www.depression-guide.com/paranoia.htm'>usually the result of trauma</a>. A medical illness can be treated with a course of a particular medicine, after which the condition (except when the condition is genetic, for obvious reasons), but these disorders are usually treated with sedatives or insulin, which alters the sugar concentration of one's blood, thus naturally combating agitation.
The practical difference psychological disorders and medical illnesses is that the former cannot be cured through medical means, like polio or influenza <i>et cetera</i>. For some reason, however, and I suspect it may have something to do with money, we continue to treat <i>behaviour</i> with drugs.",4.0

I find it funny that you act like an authority on what's scientific and whats pseudo-scientific, and don't seem to be able to tell the difference between informal argumentation and hypothesis! You side-step the fact that there is no steady source, and never mind the fact that the all the prerequisite conditions of these supposedly perfectly identical waveforms exist only theoretically, that no measurements have been ever made by anyone under such conditions, you nevertheless won't let that stop you from talking like they have.
<b>I have made no estimate; for I have made no attempt to quantify an instant. Indeed, as I hold an instant to be a circumstance in which time does not apply at all (being suspended), your argument is invalid. </b>
Now you suppose there are circumstances where time does not apply, how very scientific of you. Now I see why you hate time, it proves your ass wrong. Scientists are supposed to crave being proven wrong.
<b>The point, which it seems has eluded you (or, perhaps, which you have eluded), is that, notwithstanding the evolutions of time, the wavelengths within a ray of monochromatic light, instantaneously, within one medium, et cetera, are equal.</b>
So who has observed and made measurements of monochromatic light under such conditions. Fail to cite the research and it will be as if one of my arrows was a nuclear warhead.
<b>Or, to satisfy the corpuscular model, the energies of the photons within a ray of monochromatic light, are equal to one another.</b>
This still supposes conditions which are known to exist only hypothetically, and only speaks of what the theory <i>predicts</i> the measured results <i>would be</i> if there were such a thing as an isolated system.
<b>This is unscientific drivel. It equates to ""I have not yet measured a difference, but contrary to what I have observed, I shall believe a model which allows for them"".</b>
This is a crafty dodge on your part. I explained my point in simple terms that aren't field specific. I need not even address the quality of your counterargument, because I trust that anyone who reads them both will see which is the better formed statement. 
<b>The basis of your entire argument, is that ""imprecise instruments"" have measured differences between quantities which had been supposed to be equal.</b>
You really don't get it do you? The way that portion of my argument works is that the instruments we use to measure, however precise they may be, still only give us approximations. If equal is defined as without difference, we would need a perfectly precise way of measuring in order to verify the equality of two things. (be they monochromatic light waves or anything else)
I suppose I forgot to specifically mention that only theoretical light waves
1. pass through an unoccupied region of space
2. move unimpeded by interfering phenomena
3. emit simultaneously from a single source
I did mention however that non-imaginary light sources are in flux and then you backtracked and wanted to discuss the energy levels of orbiting electrons. You were even goofy enough to suggest that somehow this was a process ""which does not vary with time""...which seems kinda like your own flavor of ""unscientific drivel"" to me.
You went on to say:<b>It is known, that any two electrons, occupying the same energy level (and, if you like, the same orbital) must be imbued with identical energies for as long as they are so positioned.</b>, which seems to assume that they can't be ever so slightly out of balance, and merely have energy levels that are <i>not different enough</i> to immediately affect coherence. 
<b> I do not deny, that our instrumentation is imperfect, but I do demand that you hold yourself to the same standards to which you would have me adhere.</b>
Ok I promise not to presume that since I cannot yet measure a difference that there is no difference.
<b>No, sir, it was merely intended to dismiss a semantic argument which had not place in this dispute.</b>
Calling what you even admit to be multiple sources, a single source ala: <b>Obviously, a minute inspection reveals that there are in one source of light, immense numbers of individual sources</b> an out of place matter of semantics is just sidestepping the issue because you don't find it convenient.
<b>What evidence do you present, which suggests that the two are unequal?</b>
I, like you, am only arguing based on my interpretation of the evidence I've had access to.
You supposed equality under conditions that exist only theoretically.

Says the bloke who feigns to understand the complex while still struggling to understand the simple.
<b>Rather than address the issue, which is that monochromatic waveforms can be observed to move, and that their wavelengths are instantaneously identical, you have, to support your pseudoscientific hypothesis, decided to mutter some nonsense about the imprecision of my estimates.</b>
I find it funny that you act like an authority on what's scientific and whats pseudo-scientific, and don't seem to be able to tell the difference between informal argumentation and hypothesis! You side-step the fact that there is no steady source, and never mind the fact that the all the prerequisite conditions of these supposedly perfectly identical waveforms exist only theoretically, that no measurements have been ever made by anyone under such conditions, you nevertheless won't let that stop you from talking like they have.
<b>I have made no estimate; for I have made no attempt to quantify an instant. Indeed, as I hold an instant to be a circumstance in which time does not apply at all (being suspended), your argument is invalid. </b>
Now you suppose there are circumstances where time does not apply, how very scientific of you. Now I see why you hate time, it proves your ass wrong. Scientists are supposed to crave being proven wrong.
<b>The point, which it seems has eluded you (or, perhaps, which you have eluded), is that, notwithstanding the evolutions of time, the wavelengths within a ray of monochromatic light, instantaneously, within one medium, et cetera, are equal.</b>
So who has observed and made measurements of monochromatic light under such conditions. Fail to cite the research and it will be as if one of my arrows was a nuclear warhead.
<b>Or, to satisfy the corpuscular model, the energies of the photons within a ray of monochromatic light, are equal to one another.</b>
This still supposes conditions which are known to exist only hypothetically, and only speaks of what the theory <i>predicts</i> the measured results <i>would be</i> if there were such a thing as an isolated system.
<b>This is unscientific drivel. It equates to ""I have not yet measured a difference, but contrary to what I have observed, I shall believe a model which allows for them"".</b>
This is a crafty dodge on your part. I explained my point in simple terms that aren't field specific. I need not even address the quality of your counterargument, because I trust that anyone who reads them both will see which is the better formed statement. 
<b>The basis of your entire argument, is that ""imprecise instruments"" have measured differences between quantities which had been supposed to be equal.</b>
You really don't get it do you? The way that portion of my argument works is that the instruments we use to measure, however precise they may be, still only give us approximations. If equal is defined as without difference, we would need a perfectly precise way of measuring in order to verify the equality of two things. (be they monochromatic light waves or anything else)
I suppose I forgot to specifically mention that only theoretical light waves
1. pass through an unoccupied region of space
2. move unimpeded by interfering phenomena
3. emit simultaneously from a single source
I did mention however that non-imaginary light sources are in flux and then you backtracked and wanted to discuss the energy levels of orbiting electrons. You were even goofy enough to suggest that somehow this was a process ""which does not vary with time""...which seems kinda like your own flavor of ""unscientific drivel"" to me.
You went on to say:<b>It is known, that any two electrons, occupying the same energy level (and, if you like, the same orbital) must be imbued with identical energies for as long as they are so positioned.</b>, which seems to assume that they can't be ever so slightly out of balance, and merely have energy levels that are <i>not different enough</i> to immediately affect coherence. 
<b> I do not deny, that our instrumentation is imperfect, but I do demand that you hold yourself to the same standards to which you would have me adhere.</b>
Ok I promise not to presume that since I cannot yet measure a difference that there is no difference.

Calling what you even admit to be multiple sources, a single source ala: <b>Obviously, a minute inspection reveals that there are in one source of light, immense numbers of individual sources</b> an out of place matter of semantics is just sidestepping the issue because you don't find it convenient.
<b>What evidence do you present, which suggests that the two are unequal?</b>
I, like you, am only arguing based on my interpretation of the evidence I've had access to.
You supposed equality under conditions that exist only theoretically. You did not bring to bear measurements made under laboratory conditions, because readings from laboratory instrumentation are sensitive enough to quantify variance. Even barring interference from the medium, there is still the issue of non-steady state of the source. Keep sidestepping it and I will keep putting it in your face.

I shall, in the interest of brevity, abandon the Socratic method. Whether through misdirection, or insensibility, it appears that I have failed to communicate the point of the inquiry.
 I shall assume as first principles that you are composed of matter, and that you are subject to the ordinary laws which govern the interaction of matter. Now, suppose that you were sitting on a chair (as you are likely doing), preferably one which is capable of supporting your weight without disintegration. Now, I say that, instantaneously, the force of gravitation, acting upon your body, and the normal force generated (no energy is generated, was purported to have been generated, or could possibly be generated) would be equal; or that, if there be a vibration in the bodies, that the average of the two forces would be equal.
I further posit that, due to circumstances implicitly demonstrated in the scenarios above, that the total quantity of matter-energy in any closed system, or in any open system when inputs and outputs are accounted accounted for, shall remain the same.
<b>So then show your class by attempting to ridicule what you don't understand why don't you</b>
I do not entirely understand why you would cite what is obviously ironic, to demonstrate one's idiocy, but I am certain that you have your reasons.

I would not count James Boswell amongst the intelligentsia.

An instant is not a quantity of time, or of anything at all. It therefore cannot be dealt with in estimations. This is the premise upon which I have ridiculed your efforts against me.

I'll concede the latter charge. The first, I suspect, was included to augment the prose, the second made to insult the opponent. I am therefore not inclined to treat them as serious accusations.

<b>Says the bloke who feigns to understand the complex while still struggling to understand the simple.</b>
I am simply extending to you the courtesy, of assuming that you understand what a Platonic Ideal is, and why they are relevant. I could end the empirical debate quite easily, I suspect, by proposing, that the fluctuations of time notwithstanding, the sum of all quantities in the universe remains the same. To remain the same, should be impossible, if the Platonic Ideal of equality were fictional.
No single observation or measurement can verify this, of course. However, the whole sum of observations and measurements that have ever been taken, anywhere, under scientific conditions supports the notion. You could, if you were so inclined, suggest that such a finite number of observations is insufficient, but then such would constitute an attack on empiricism itself, which would not avail you. 
<b>I find it funny that you act like an authority on what's scientific and whats pseudo-scientific, and don't seem to be able to tell the difference between informal argumentation and hypothesis! </b>
I am glad that you have profited in some way from this exchange.
<b>You side-step the fact that there is no steady source</b>
I had supposed that fact (for here we agree) to be irrelevant. The very fact that there are intelligible laws which govern waveforms, suggests that there is a Platonic Ideal of equality, and that identical wavelengths are possible.
<b>and never mind the fact that the all the prerequisite conditions of these supposedly perfectly identical waveforms exist only theoretically, that no measurements have been ever made by anyone under such conditions, you nevertheless won't let that stop you from talking like they have.</b>
I don't believe that I suggested that they had been. Obviously, you are attempting to defeat my arguments (and you are at liberty to question whether they constitute arguments) by asking for empirically obtained data which cannot be provided. I find this itself to be disingenuous, for you have yourself agreed that no instrumentation is precise enough to determine equality.
The greater deficiency of your line of inquiry, however, is that it is entirely inefficacious. Obviously, I am arguing on a Platonic plane. The quotation from Euclid, a section of which forms the title of this debate, also dealt with the Platonic plane; I had supposed this to be obvious. The reason for which I am sullying my hands, by the presentation of scenarios which exist within the imperfect world, and to which we must ascribe a degree of uncertainty, owing to the imperfection of our instruments and faculties, is because you give all the indications of being entirely ignorant of what a Platonic Ideal is. You may, indeed, have read of them, or have studied them, but you appear to have been unable to recognise them, when they were the topic of debate. 
I write, content in the suspicion that you will likely declare the above to be pseudo-intellectual (though, if Plato and Euclid were pseudo-intellectuals...) or an attempt to change the topic. For this reason, I shall iterate, in unequivocal language, what are my opinions upon the matter of equality. As a footnote, you may take magnitude for quantity, in most cases.
<i>Of the Platonic Equality</i>
I. Forms exist, as do properties and quantities.
II. The same properties may be measured, and expressed in equal units of quantity.
III. To measure, therefore, requires a concept of equality.
IV To measure a quantity or its effects, is the only empirical means of assessing quantity. 
V. Therefore empirical measurement, by III and IV, admits discourse of Platonic equality.
<i>Of empirical equality</i>
I. Instrumentation, though marvellously advanced, remains imperfect.
II. Therefore measurements made by instrumentation shall be imperfect.
III. Equality of quantity can only be ascertained with certainty by perfect measurement.
IV. By II and III, equality cannot be empirically, viz, by measurement, proved to exist.
Corollary I. Equality cannot, by the same principle, be empirically proven not to exist. 
<i>Of geometry</i>
I. Mathematical tautologies are always true.
II. Geometry is a branch of mathematics.
III. Geometry represents the relationships between real objects and quantities.
IV. Geometry may be and has been used to demonstrate equality in such relationships. <i>See Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Book I, section II, for a choice example</i>.
III. Equality exists in reality.
<i>Of divisibility of quantity</i>
I. Quantities may be measured.
II. Quantities so measured are implicitly divided.
III. The units into which a measured quantity is divided, are equal to one another.
IV. By II and III, every empirical measurement supposes equality to exist, to ensure its own efficacy.
<i>Grand conclusion</i>
Equality exists, and empiricism cannot, without destroying itself, disprove its existence.",4.0
88,./to_process\debate.show.All_thing_which_are_equal_lj.xml,All thing which are equal,"<b>Can you explain the nature of our disagreement?</b>
As I see it, sir, the nature of our dispute is thus:
<i><b>A history</b></i>
Finding contention with Euclid's first common notion, which is the premise of debate, you argued that empirical data renders dubious the concept of equality. Perceiving this, I argued first that empirical imperfection cannot disprove a Platonic Ideal; for, it is the nature of the empirical world to be only an imperfect manifestation of the same.
I, not having properly adhered to a classical structure of argument, foolishly fought upon the Platonic field with weapons more suited to mundane combat. <i>Videlicet</i>, I couched Platonic argument in empirical terms, which confused the issue. This gave you occasion to call into question the authority with which I pronounced upon these matters.
Finding that my line of argument was provoking hostility, I reverted to First Principles, which if my notions be correct, ought to be unassailable. 
<i><b>A summary</b></i>
By the history above, the nature of our dispute has been obfuscated. In essence, therefore, I shall declare it: I maintain that equality is a real Platonic Ideal which is essential to empirical measurement, whereas you maintain that empirical measurement disproves the concept of equality.","<b>I maintain that equality is a real Platonic Ideal which is essential to empirical measurement, whereas you maintain that empirical measurement disproves the concept of equality.</b>
I do not dispute that equality is ""a real Platonic Ideal which is essential to empirical measurement"", however, that empirical measurement ""renders dubious the concept of equality"" remains my position.

Because there is no evidence whether they exist or not. But it is more reasonable to presume they do not. Every different turn of the smallest amount of energy would cause a different universe. You do know how many versions of our universes that would mean? Far too many to be real if you ask me.
<b>Why is it most probable that we will never have evidence?</b>
And how would you go about finding the evidence? For that you should, literally, be able to break through our universe, one way or another. Sounds like science fiction, as at this point it is. Something that might be possible but there is no evidence, no proof.
We are capable of coming up with scenarios that do not have any evidence and, again, most probably never will. In this case it would be wise and smart to recognize the false ones and and claim them unreal, until further notice... still.
<b>If we do have no evidence and if probability is against us of finding evidence, that doesn't mean alternate realities don't exist.</b>
Assuming that all of existence, not just our universe, is infinite. There is a possibility that somewhere out there could be every ""alternate"" version of everything that is over here. But that just sounds not true.
The universe began with a ""bang"". All the energies and particles and whatnot that came from there, their course could be tracked and projected, theoretically, till the ""end"". If there is no external influence to their path they will always go the same way. It could, theoretically, be possible to look into the future and change the course of events, but then that is still the path of particles, energies, etc. and would be part of the projection from the beginning. Only an influence that came from outside our universe could actually ""change"" the course. But that would not create another universe. The current one would be changed and that change would be permanent.

It proves that you are talking to someone you know nothing about. Therefore, the person you are talking to exists, but you do not know who it is.

94,./to_process\debate.show.Am_I_Omnipotent_lj.xml,Am I Omnipotent,"<b>""You're putting limitations on god based on the rules of the reality we live in...""</b>
Basically, yes. I think you have to. I believe that, in order for something to exist, it must be subject to the nature of existence. Existence behaves a certain way, and anything that can be said to exist is subject to this behavior. Axioms such as the Law of Identity are ways we describe this behavior, and serve as a basis for logic. 
If something is not subject to these ""laws of existence,"" or ""laws of reality,"" then I don't think it can be said to exist, as it's not meeting the requirements of existence. Obviously, since theists want to show that God exists, they must allow for God to be subject the nature of what it is to exist. Thus, God cannot create or do things that are not consistent with the nature of existence.
This is why the simplest definition of omnipotence, ""X can do everything,"" isn't valid. It doesn't exclude things that are logically impossible. 
So, the definition changes to ""X can do everything that is logically possible to do."" This is still a problem though, because God is not just limited to the laws of existence. God is limited (mostly) to his moral nature as presented in the Bible. God cannot lie, God cannot commit an immoral act, etc. This means there are some things that are logically possible but not possible for a being with God's traditional properties.
So, the definition changes again. ""X can do everything that is logically possible for a being with X's defining properties."" This is the definition I was running with here, so the problem is obvious. Once you allow omnipotence to be relativised to a set of properties, it opens up the possibility for multiple omnipotent beings. You could have a being whose defining property is the inability to do anything, and it would be compatible with this definition of omnipotence.
The definition can evolve further, stating that ""X can do everything that is logically possible for a being with X's defining properties to do; and there is no being conceivable with greater powers than X."" But this definition runs into the same problem as the second. There are logically possible things God cannot do due to His being morally perfect. A being could be conceived that is like God, but isn't morally perfect. This being could do everything God could, as well as perform morally evil acts. This being would be more powerful than God.","<b>If something is not subject to these ""laws of existence,"" or ""laws of reality,"" then I don't think it can be said to exist, as it's not meeting the requirements of existence.</b>
Well yes. Christians and many theists are arguing for something that defies the laws of reality, and this is one of many things that leads me to believe that god doesn't exist. But this doesn't mean that he doesn't defy the laws of reality - even if you're assuming his existence for the sake of argument, that doesn't change the fact that he does the impossible. 
<b>It doesn't exclude things that are logically impossible.</b>
I don't think it has to, as the logically impossible is just a day at work for god. If he only did easy, logical, possible things, I don't think he would be worshiped as a god. 
<b>God cannot lie, God cannot commit an immoral act, etc.</b>
Woah, who said god can't be immoral? I know the Bible <i>tries</i> to paint a good picture of god for public consumption, but if you read it cover to cover I think you'll find god to be quite an immoral character. Immense power doesn't imply perfect morals - Christians just want god to work that way. Look at the Greek gods; immensely powerful, but just as flawed as humans, morally. 
<b>Once you allow omnipotence to be relativised to a set of properties</b>
I don't. You and Chuck have been trying to do this, but when I am confronted with the idea of an all-powerful being who is by definition unknowable, I don't see myself as being able to put limitations on that power because I don't know god. I know you don't know him either, because you're a human, just like me. So I go with the standard definition of omnipotence; that any being who is all powerful can do whatever the fuck they want.",4.0

It's perfectly fair for the a British person to dislike French policy choices (and many do), and it's fair for them to dislike aspects of French culture- perhaps they think wine is an inappropriate beverage for those under eighteen, for instance.

Indeed, we classify animals: There are monkeys, cats, dogs, humans. There are also vertebrates, invertebrates. There are reptilians, arachnids… But we don’t classify short men vs tall men; we measure them in inches or feet or centimeters and give their height a number. We don’t classify specific physical traits like blond or brunette; those are inherited by the way. Maybe it would be more acceptable to measure the level of skin pigmentations and classify by range. At least it would be objectively measured.

This is a conflict of ideology, with no end in sight; nevertheless I shall persevere.

Not really. When was the last time a democratic government ceased an activity, repealed a law or abstained from some new tax because of public demands.

Yes. Now you answer mine.
<b>Democracy is as much a tyranny as the worst autocracy</b>
Not true at all. Officials can fail to be re-elected. It happens all the time. They can be impeached.
<b>After he is elected, he can do as he pleases, so long as he corrupts the necessary people, which is always possible.</b>
Not if a government has appropriate checks on power. I suppose <i>technically</i> he still could, but then anyone could do anything assuming they ""corrupt the necessary people"", so this is not a useful statement.
<b>When was the last time a democratic government ceased an activity, repealed a law or abstained from some new tax because of public demands.</b>
It doesn't happen very often, but I would say that's because democratic governments generally don't pass unpopular laws.
<b>Rather let us have one Caesar, one champion of the people.</b>
What makes you think this Caesar would be a champion of the people?
<b>Modern democracy ultimately consists of idiots choosing between two or more groups of idiots.</b>
Not true. Intelligence is normally distributed. And I think the bell-curve of both the electorate and the elected must be skewed to the right.
<b>I do not bow before something so fickle as the tyranny of the masses.</b>
You do it every day. If you didn't you would be arrested.
<b>people do not know what they want</b>
They do when it comes to certain things. People generally want sustinence, safety, good relationships, etc. I think it's safe to say they know they want these things.
<b>They are so staggeringly stupid that you can tell them what they want and they will believe you.</b>
I don't think this is true. People can be influenced to various degrees -- but if it were so easy to shape opinion, democratic processes would be a lot less contentious.
<b>Being allowed to kill your daughter's rapist does not equate to a license to kill indiscriminately.</b>
Why should you be able to disregard the rule of law in one case but not another? Would such hypocrisy not undermine the law's authority?
<b>In this case you would simply lead the killers to your family, endangering them as well.</b>

The element of a king and queen introduces an element of immediate social inequality, and a sacrifice of merit, because a bloodline does not guarantee fitness for the task.
The big way that your system can fail is through the royalty working together with the dictator to grant him perpetual autocratic rights. The monarchs may wish for complete power and would use the dictator as a proxy for their authority, especially if favours are provided to the dictator. Another way this could fail is by dictators slowly lengthening the period of their absolute power, until it is for years or even a lifetime.
Your system creates competition between two parties for complete control, with cooperation being a way in which they can achieve it, or infighting to cancel the other out.
<b>I believe I have addressed this with my system.</b>
If you distribute power amongst many, then it becomes very difficult to amass influence. The risk only comes in cooperation amongst groups of those who share power, to form a kind of gang based on shared values.

Man is a self-perpetuation machine first, and a rational being only to the extent that serves the former. Rationalization and self-deception are vices even the wisest cannot escape. We need systems which account and compensate for our common weaknesses.
<b>Thus far I have never had cause to break the law, but if I had a reason, I would do so without pause.</b>
You have never refrained from an activity because if was illegal? Now I think you are simply lying to yourself. Arrogance can make honest introspection difficult.
Look: why don't you rob a convenience store? Tell them you are appropriating their money in order to fund the New British Empire, of which you are the sole authority. It's for their own good of course. I think you will not do this. I think you can come up with some clever sounding bullshit excuse for not doing it, but the real reason you don't do it is that you would be arrested.
<b>I was speaking politically, of course.</b>
People don't know what they want politically? Well that's wrong too. People want, and will vote for, policies which they think will benefit them, policies which forward their idealogical views, etc. People aren't going to vote for someone who promises a fork in the eye for everyone, I don't care how dazzling their smile. I'm afraid you're going to have to elaborate if you really think this isn't true.
<b>This is because those elected are often as impressionable and stupid as those who elected them.</b>
I don't think you're really saying anything here, other than declaring people other than yourself stupid. How does stupidity in elected officials lead to contentious politics? Do you think the debate about, say, whether to invade Iraq was worthless? That it was just a mob of idiots without any reasonable arguments?
<b>That is like saying that varying the magnitude of punishments undermines the authority of laws that do not carry high penalties.</b>
What? How are the two anything alike? You breaking laws while expecting others to obey them is hypocrital. Having a punishment fit the crime is not. I really don't see any connection here.
<b>Honour does not consist of doing the logical thing.</b>
There is a logical component to it.
<b>Then presumably I can use whatever means are available to do so.</b>
Yes, in theory. But what I'm saying is, in reality you would fail to rule justly if you had unlimited power because you are human and humans are flawed. Unchecked power is inevitably abused.","<b>He lives.</b>

As I have said, it is in his own interest to serve their best interests.
<b>Do you think you are such a being?</b>
Yes, in a manner of speaking. You underestimate my devotion to England.
<b>Man is a self-perpetuation machine first, and a rational being only to the extent that serves the former. </b>
This is why you struggle with the concept of honour. You cannot comprehend why a man would die for an idea.
<b>You have never refrained from an activity because if was illegal?</b>
No. I have never felt a passing interest in the rape, robbing or destruction of a person such as would warrant the defiance of a law. However, if I felt threatened by a law, I would by all means attempt to destroy it. 
<b>ook: why don't you rob a convenience store?</b>
Because I am a compassionate capitalist. 
<b>Tell them you are appropriating their money in order to fund the New British Empire, of which you are the sole authority.</b>
Taking money in order to fund the official government is called taxation and equates to this scenario.

No, it is for the reasons so recently expressed.
<b>People don't know what they want politically?</b>
Of course not, else majority favour would not swing so often.
<b>People want, and will vote for, policies which they think will benefit them, policies which forward their idealogical views, etc.</b>
See, they don't understand half of these policies, as political parties masquerade their agendas as legitimate plans of action. When they do something right, it is to secure their own dominance, whereafter they may for some years do as they please. The constant to and fro has left most people either confused or fanatic. The confused do not understand by default, whereas the fanatics know only what they have been told to know, figuratively speaking. More literally, they have been told by those they favour that such is the case, therefore such must be done. They rarely understand the ramifications of either their political inertia or the policies they blindly support.
<b>I don't think you're really saying anything here, other than declaring people other than yourself stupid.</b>
I have proved my own intelligence many times over. I have reached a point where I can safely observe the folly of others. Whatever activities you partake of either don't bring you into contact with the ruck, or you are one of them.

So you really think you are capable of putting aside your innate desire to increase your power relative to others. While at the same time arguing for a position that would give you a great amount of power relative to others. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and not call you a liar, but it seems quite clear that you are suffering from massive cognitive dissonance.
<b>For such a person, the possibility of such a situation arising is negligible.</b>
Bullshit. This is argument by hand-waving. If your power were to be threatened by another of comparable merit, your interests would rapidly diverge from those of the people. And that's just one example.

An autocrat's relative power is not necessarily tied to the state's well being.

I think this is a legitimate criticism. Longer term limits might help here. Short-sighted legislation is a danger that should be mitigated as much as possible, but eliminating it completely would be difficult. However, this not a sufficient reason to jump from here to autocracy.

One way would be if a group or some of the ""smart people"" could find a way to power and then find and increase the support for them (a support based on truth not lies). I think that finding the support should be made rather secretly, outside their rivals' sight. Once they have that it should be rather easy to change things.
It is not unrealistic. People just don't go for it, they have grown up in a seemingly ""safe"" and comfortable world and are afraid of change. Thinking it will mess up everything when in fact it would improve everything.

I believe that man is innately sinful… and without the grace of God is completely helpless against his sin nature which envelopes him… I have no faith in the human condition whatsoever… I have faith in God to save humanity from sin and impending death (eternal death).

Well, it might help you to empathise if you think of an apatheist's attitude towards god as being the same attitude you hold towards Dionysus, the god of wine. You are satisfied that Dionysus doesn't exist, and don't really care enough about him to try and convince others of it.

We <i>are</i> innately sinful and stupid creatures, but that doesn't mean we're not capable of working to better ourselves.

Back when there was a lot more anarchy, and chaos and etc. and people did not have any answers for anything, religion gave a pretty good guess as long as it sounded convincing. The idea that there was a divine reason behind everything made it easier to cope with our lack of understanding. To be simple, it was a very reliable and useful crutch. However, eventually, we're going to have to get rid of the crutch if we ever want to run.

To me, this highlights your naive view of how force works. The settlers rolled in with guns, took their land, enslaved them and killed any that didn't join them. Even when they did join the settler's society they were discriminated against, didn't get fair treatment in the legal system and were oppressed because of their race.

<b>They found fish in the mountains peaks and most fish fossils are in the ocean</b>
Mountains are formed by the plates in the earth's crust pushing together, causing the land to rise where they collide. So, land that was once under the ocean rises up and forms a mountain. That's why fish fossils are there. In addition to that, many rivers and streams are from snow melt on mountains. Those streams run all the way down the mountain. Fish are more than capable of swimming upstream into the mountains. I hike in the mountains all the time and there are lots of fish in the streams and lakes up there.",4.0

<b> Also because, by definition, all agree that Atheism is the belief in no God, be that christian or pagan.</b>
The majority of atheists I have talked to would disagree with that. Also to accept this as the definition of atheism throws all consistency of the English language out the window. The prefix A- means not or without when attached tosomething you are negating it. Apolitic - not political, Asymmetrical - not symmetrical, Amoral - not moral, yet atheism means a denial of god or a belief god doesn't exist... It just makes no.sense. if we are going to depend on language for communication we should be consistent should we not? Atheism should (though the average dictionary disagrees, where as fewer dictionaries actually hold this definition) means to lack belief in god(s). Atheists that believe there is no god are a sub-category of atheism called strong atheism.
<b> As agnostics don't wholly believe, they also don't wholly disbelieve the existence of a god. The rest in between.</b>
They hold no belief in god making thematheists. They aren't theists making them atheist. Atheist by definition is anyone who claims to not be a theist by definition, just like asymmetric means to not be symmetric, or amoral means to not be moral. If you are completely in he middle finding god(s) existence and non-existence to be completely equiprobable are technically atheists since they hold no belief in god(s).
<b> Apatheists, only by Wikipedia, just disregard belief in God all together. They don't completly omit the idea of a god, they just don't care. So they don't actually believe he doesn't exist, they just lack a belief that he may.</b>

All human language really is, is a string of a sounds with meaning attached to them. If we are going to depend on such means of communication we should try to be consistent with its workings and rules. To accept atheism to mean anything but a lack of belief is denying god the prefix A- needs to be redifined as denial of, so all Apoliticals must be referred to as those who are in denial of politics, asymmetrical must only be used for objects that denial of symmetry, Amorality must mean to denial of morality.

The horn could belong to a unicorn, but I could create an entire beatiary of mythical animals I completely made up and argue for each animal individually for being the creature the horn belonged to. This is illogical, it's better to document the horn, preserve it, and let researchers and scientists try to find out where the horn truly came from by finding the animal first, if there is a good reason to suspect certain details of an animal, that is one thing, (like poison being on the tip the horn, then we could assume that the animal could have had poison reserves somewhere in the body to use to inject into other creatures with its horn).

Really that is what you think is the only reason. Explain to me why the Big Bang model states the microwave radiation temperature of space should be 3 Kelvin, yet it has been shown to be 2.7 Kelvin throughout. Do you know how they solve this? With dark energy, that is an unknown and untestable form of energy that we can't detect. It was made up to explain the discrepancy. What about the fact that all visible objects (that is through the electromagnetic spectrum) only comprises 10% of the mass in space. So they can't account for the mass that holds galaxies in place. This is when they made up dark matter. An unknown mass that is not detectable (that is through the electromagnetic spectrum) is what comprises the other 90% of mass in space. And this is more believable? Talking about blind faith right there. How could you say naturalism is the answer when it is all hypothesized?

There is still so much about the laws of nature that we don't know. We have barely scratched the surface. By comparison, your concept of God looks very primitive and/or archaic.

You see, this is one of those huge misunderstandings about statistics, and how properly to use them in an argument.

156,./to_process\debate.show.Are_big_corporations_good_or_bad_lj.xml,Are big corporations good or bad?,"Big corporations are machines of economic centralization and economic stratification. They tend to suck up huge amounts of wealth and capital and deliver it to a rather small number of people. 
This sort of concentration of wealth has several consequences:
1. First and foremost, large corporations have the ability to dominate local markets. Shoving out smaller businesses and keeping new ones from developing. 
2. Wealth becomes stratified and concentrated in the greater population. This has ramifications for the economy as a whole; it can produce recessions due to a large number of people who have little to no real wage growth and an increasing amount of capital that cannot be spent on investments due to the fact that demand is not increasing. Economic stagnation tends to occur because of this process.
Another problem comes with innovation; big corporations are essentially economic bureaucracies. A small number of people make the decisions and approve the ideas while the vast majority of people have little to no say in how things are run and what products and services are produced (and how). 
3. Money is power, the large the corporation and the more our economy is dominated by large corporations the more political power corporations have. Because of the wealth concentration effects of corporations we see a complete shift of power away from lower and middle-class people and towards the rich who own the corporations as well as the corporations themselves. (The CEO of Mcdonalds and the Mcdonalds corporation can, independently, give to a particular political party or candidate). 
If you believe in democracy you should be fairly worried about this trend. 
Also, the domination of a few media conglomerates; the control of all of our major sources of information and communication, is also worrisome in a democracy. It guarantees that certain viewpoints will never be expressed (or be expressed sparingly) and others will be pushed extensively. 
Fox News is not the only guilty party, all of the major media outlets censor the information being given to us.","<b>1. First and foremost, large corporations have the ability to dominate local markets. Shoving out smaller businesses and keeping new ones from developing.</b>
Smaller businesses can continue to exist if they are savvy. They could, and have, cornered niche markets that stores like Wal-mart can't, such as. local market food, or any unique product. The only time they go out of business is when they are selling a like product and can't keep their prices low enough, thereby directing the consumer to big box stores where the same thing costs less. In that sense it is the people, not the big businesses, that drive out smaller businesses. Also, most of these stores like walmart are retailers, and their products come from a large variety of other companies, creating internal competition.
Also, I actually haven't seen this phenomenon happen on the scale normally described. In my home town we have a walmart as well as a plethora of small businesses including bookstores, restaurant, clothing stores, music and electronic stores, repair shops and variety stores. Though these places are have generally higher prices, they also have a selection that is very different from the select brands Walmart offers. 
In the city (Halifax) the story is even better. There are more than 3 big box stores meaning they are in competition, and downtown where huge retailers can't fit small business is flourishing. I think the argument that they ""shove out smaller businesses"" comes from a type of unfounded cynicism. The people controlling the market are the consumers. Ultimately you are the ones, collectively, who put out of business the uncompetitive. 
<b>2. Wealth becomes stratified and concentrated in the greater population.</b>
That is an awfully dubious claim. Could you cite some empirical data? In general, big corporations raise the living standards of everyone because of the low prices they are able to afford, and profit they make goes right to the stock holders who often depend on big business for their retirement etc. or back into investment. Look at Exxon Mobil. Sure they're making huge profits in terms of ""that number is big."" But relative to what they spend, they only get 9.8 cents for every dollar of revenue. That is low. The rest goes back into innovation, exploration, mutual funds, and other things that do precisely the opposite of concentrate wealth. Truth be told, only a handful of executives and presidents get the million dollar salaries -- still less than Judge Judy might I add. To give you a comparison, Google's profit margin is 29.89%, Walmart 3.5%, Shell Oil 7.9% (average profit margin for the last 20 years has been 8.3%). Only one solution. Tax Google's record profits! Or how bout no, because Google and everyone else benefits from putting that revenue back into the system.
<b>Another problem comes with innovation; big corporations are essentially economic bureaucracies. A small number of people make the decisions and approve the ideas while the vast majority of people have little to no say in how things are run and what products and services are produced (and how).</b>
I'd appreciate some examples for what your saying. Stock holders have a say. Consumers have a say. And they make their say by not buying the product. Here, if you don't like Coke and Pepsi for reason X, then buy the locally brewed soda. Propeller Soda Pop is a locally run business and, in my opinion, they taste better too. Also, it is true that the there is a lot of economic bureaucracy in big business. But what's the alternative? Oh yah, coercive bureaucracy ie. government.

Advertising is a part of any successful enterprise, and I do not believe that if company X sells product A for a cheaper price than company Y, that company X will not have enough money from people flocking to that place for the lower prices to advertise on a larger scale! That's how all companies start out, and that's ultimately how retailers become successful. Minimal advertising attracts a basis for future advertisement. In fact, the only benefit Wal-mart has in advertisement is that it's on a national scale. That kind of advertisement would be useless to a local business that only really requires fliers and a newspaper spot.
<i>Big businesses have other advantages that small businesses (in their industry) cannot compete with.</i>
The only tangible advantage big business has is the sense that they're successful and have a reason that success. That's like saying ""successful businesses have an advantage over unsuccessful businesses, insofar as they're more successful."" That suffers from conspicuously poor logic. As I said, ultimately the consumer decides, and they in the mass, always decide toward the company that gives the best quality and quantity for the least cost (which is usually the larger businesses). This is the nature of competition, and very basic economic theory. 
<i>When certain markets or regions take an economic downturn; say the state of Missouri sees a major economic slump and consumer demand plunges. Wal-Mart and other major stores can continue to operate off of the profits from other areas of the country. Small businesses, however, don't have the luxury of a vast supply of income from a variety of regions and sources.</i>
How is that a bad thing? Companies like Sears and Wal-mart etc. have been the last hope for many regions hit with disaster. They're more resilient, and that is a very good thing for people who need food, clothing, and shelter immediately after a natural disaster or economic downturn. Once people are back on their feet they can, with the same ease, reopen their enterprise without any resistance. 
<i>Also, big corporations can go into a developing area; drop their prices way below the competition (taking a loss) and use the profits from other areas of the country (or world) to wait for the other businesses to go under, close, and then put their prices back up to normal.</i>
It would have to be a very developing area, because the places with the most people unusually have many big retailers like Chapters, Futureshop, Target, Macy's, Barnes & Noble, Old Navy, Winners, and down the list that are all in a sort of competition for the best retailer. In smaller developing areas, where there are admittedly less people effected, what you describe is possible. Again, though, as in my hometown where we basically only have a Wal-mart when it comes to big name suppliers, businesses can always (and always do) reopen once the prices are low. This is a necessary fact for the simple reason that towns need employment -- more than Wal-mart can satisfy. Nevertheless, the stores that Wal-mart ends up shutting down are stores that sell like-goods for higher costs. Niche markets remain open unabated. Again, however unfortunate you wish make this out to be, it was completely determined by consumers democratically moving their business to Wal-mart. 
<i>People will buy discount poison drops if they said ""quality pain killer"" on it.</i>
Hopefully not without suing the making for fraud.
<i>Just because people are making bad choices doesn't mean it legitimizes the choice.</i>
Why are they bad choices? Over all, the existence of a Wal-mart or like business in small communities is indicative of local wealth. In other words, it's a sign of economic health. Just because a few business owners get hurt along the way doesn't make it a bad choice, nor does it negate the fact that it is completely determined my the consumer. All you are doing is describing facts of competition -- a positive trait of capitalism. 
<i> Just because people are willing to buy cheap goods made from children in sweatshops doesn't mean that choice is legitimate and shouldn't be taken away.</i>
Why not? Because of capital flow and economic globalization have caused poverty rates to drop dramatically in places like China, compared to areas less affected by globalization, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, where poverty rates have remained stagnant. I understand the desire for good working conditions in these developing countries, but the simple fact is that if it weren't for the ""sweat shops"" they would be completely jobless. Capitalism with reduced trade barriers stands alone in it's ability to raise people out of poverty, sweat shops being a starting point (in the last 20 years the number of people in developing countries living under $1 a day has dropped from 40% to 20%).
""The percentage of people living on less than $2 a day has decreased greatly in areas effected by globalization, whereas poverty rates in other areas have remained largely stagnant. In East-Asia, including China, the percentage has decreased by 50.1% compared to a 2.2% increase in Sub-Saharan Africa."" So you see what you are characterizing as the problem is in actuality the beginnings of the solution.
<i>People don't have the economic right to preference slavery over freemen factory goods. Are you saying we should legalize slavery and let the market decide?</i>

I don't quite understand what you're asking, nor does that link you gave me give nearly enough details. However, here are some (i think) relevant things to bare in mind. 'These statistics do not tell the whole story. Taken alone, they portray workers’ living standards in the most negative light possible by ignoring almost a third of what workers earn. Benefits are an increasingly large component of worker compensation and now account for 30 percent of workers’ pay—and this proportion has risen sharply in recent years. Ignoring benefits misses much of what workers actually earn, but that is what the eco­nomic pessimists do.'
'Another of the pessimists’ claims is that workers are being shortchanged because wages have not kept pace with productivity growth.[21] Since 1995, worker productivity has increased rapidly. Employ­ees now produce far more per hour than at any time in the past. According to economic theory, competition should force companies to pass on productivity gains to their workers as higher wages and compensation.'
'However, the current lag in wage growth is not unprecedented; in fact, it is familiar. Wages and productivity often diverge during the course of the business cycle. For example, pro­ductivity grew faster than compensa­tion for several years after the recovery from the 1991 recession. The last reces­sion ended in November 2001, five years ago. At this same point following the end of the 1991 recession, productivity had risen 8.4 percent, while compensation had risen only 5.2 percent.'
'Earnings growth did not match productivity growth in the 1990s until 1997, when the unem­ployment rate fell and companies faced competi­tion to hire increasingly productive workers. As a result, incomes shot up. By 1999, employee com­pensation had fully caught up to the productivity gains of the early 1990s. In the end, income and productivity did move together, but that result took several years to reach.'

I read the beginning of that Forbes article and question whether you actually read it all. The article prefaces the theory that bureaucracy stifles innovation, and then the author of the article goes on to show categorically why this is false. It's almost like what creationists do when they quote Darwin talking about the improbability of the eye evolving... right before he goes on to explain how the eye evolved. Talk about tunnel-vision! In fact, the header on the second page of the article reads ""HOW BUREAUCRACY AIDS INNOVATION"".
<i>Not exactly anti-business organizations, yet they both talk about how large corporations tend to stagnate when it comes to innovation.</i>
Do you have any credibility left? You should that you have no desire to read past the first paragraph, when the last paragraph in the preamble states: ""In the following passages, I will take you through several examples of how bureaucracy and tight controls are facilitating, contributing to, and supporting the innovation efforts in some large, diversified, and well-known corporations.""
Innovation may very well work with bureaucracy, but incentives to innovate are a market force. That's why America has the best health care technology in the world, and why countries with socialized medicine ride on America's back for new advances.
Your other link from portfolio doesn't seem to contradict this either. The author is in fact praising companies like Apple and Wal-Mart. He goes on to explain how companies take over a market they plateau. They have no real reason to innovate, just like a species adapted to its environment has no need to evolve. ""The reward is that they get big. The punishment is that when they get big, it gets harder and harder for them to grow,"" says Grove, which is in essence exactly what I said earlier. It is undesirable for a company to have an absolute monopoly. 
The main purpose of that article is to discuss the theory of ""cross boundary disruption,"" where a corporation diverges from it's normal industry ""with an innovative product or service [to] shake up the status quo and reap big profits."" He cites many examples of this. This is a positive aspect of capitalism and is the opposite of ""yet they both talk about how large corporations tend to stagnate when it comes to innovation.""
<a href='http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/casse/2103'>Commentarymagazine</a> reports, ""The amount Grove is spending is a fraction of what the Gates Foundation has, but you do get the sense that his “creative capitalism” is far more rigorous than what Gates has in mind. For Grove, the problem isn’t the nature of capitalism, it is the lack of contrarian second-guessing within business and governments that is the real enemy of innovation.""
I'm happy to see the things you are citing against capitalism are in fact for capitalism.
<i>First of all, a small government would give even greater power to corporations; without a strong government most decisions would be left up, directly, to those with the most economic power; not indirectly through bribes, lobbying, and campaign funding.</i>
I think I already covered, and indeed economic theorist settled this decades ago, that a companies interest is the consumers interest so long as market forces exist. Big government takes away these market forces, making a company immune, and thus removing the incentive to lower prices and increase quality for market share.
<i>Tell me, how on earth is a politician supposed to get elected without campaign contributions? How on earth are they supposed to get elected without the assistance of mass media? Without support from big business and the media another candidate would simply get in who is.</i>
I agree. The political system is very corruptible in terms of the shady exchange between special interests and politicians. That wouldn't be an issue though, if politicians didn't have such power. It's only under a Keynesian frame of mind that government has exploded in size, especially so under the Bush administration. A limited government would have, of course, limited powers. In my dream world no one person in America would have the power to bomb Iran, or invade a country, or to wire tap, or execute, and so on, thus making it nearly impossible for a single corrupt soul from ruining the country. Of course it is still possible, but much more difficult. 
<i>In other words, there are plenty of honest politicians or people who want to be honest politicians. The problem is that the system rewards the dishonest.</i>
Completely agree. Ironically, this is an argument against decreasing government size and powers, and increasing government transparency. 
<i>We cannot have a Democracy with a small government, we would end up in a true Plutocracy; a society government exclusively by the rich.</i>
You mean like Russia, or China, or North Korea, or Cuba, or Venezuela, or Briton, or Norway, or, pardon me, the United States of America? Do you honestly think the Obamas, Kennedys, Bushes, Clintons etc. are poor? 
No, in a limited government the ruling class is the average citizen. I also, like most libertarians, advocate power being allocated to the 50 states and the states being sovereign. They should be able to create their regulations and bylaws without overruling by federal law (except the constitution) or supreme court ruling, and the ""executive branch"" should probably be removed all together.
This would open up a multiparty system because ideologies are typically geographical (bible belt, North East liberals, etc.). The only reason we have a 2 party system in America now is because the Democratic platform and the Republican platform are vague enough to make all other potential parties (communist, green, libertarian, marijuana) conform. This would make the representative government truly representative. Of course, this is going off topic from capitalism, and I do not speak for all capitalists.
<i>I also wonder why you only see fit to blame politicians and never corporations. Are corporations small children who are just swept up in political corruption by accident? They know exactly what they are doing, they are doing it for their bottom line, and to blame politicians only is to, again, be intellectual dishonest.</i>
I beg to differ. Corporations always want to appeal to three things. The stock holders, their employees, and their customers. This is the break down of the profit motive. So they pursue not technically ""their self interest"". The corporation isn't a person. It is made up of those three parts. So who is to blame? The corporation for pursuing the bottom line for it's components (which runs the economy), or crooked politicians for enabling them to now follow the rules. When discussing cause and effect, it is the new condition that is usually attributed to the cause, be it the finger that pulls the trigger, or the congressmen that opens the door for the special interest?
<i>No matter what political system, big government, small government, monarchy, theocracy, dictatorship...the people who hold economic power hold political power. It's beguiling that you don't seem to recognize this.</i>
What political power, under the system I have described, does the ""big corporation"" have? They don't hold power. They do under the current system. In my system it is the individual who has the power. The citizen. 
<i>People cannot make good, logical decisions when their information is controlled by either political or economic entities with a vested interest in their deception.</i>
Deception is fraud, and there is room under my system for class action law suits. Simply saying ""they will lie for profit"" is not enough. You have to prove that it is feasible that they will lie when the law prohibits it.","<i>It never matters whether or not a given product or service is superior; a small business could be outdoing Wal-Mart in price (and, in my experience, Wal-Mart's prices aren't lower, at least for what I used to buy there), it doesn't matter though, as Wal-Mart is ""known"" for low prices, just like Uncle Bill's Snake Oil is ""known"" for curing baldness, scurvy, and depression.</i>
<b>Advertising is a part of any successful enterprise, and I do not believe that if company X sells product A for a cheaper price than company Y, that company X will not have enough money from people flocking to that place for the lower prices to advertise on a larger scale! </b>
What you seem to underestimate in your argument is the power of a brand. Branding has been at work on such a large scale, that nearly all choices are affected by it. As a child, McDonald's makes you a lifelong customer through advertisements and Happy Meals (associating a clown and toys with their food). 
If you want proof that superior products do not win out over branding, just look at beer. 1,500 breweries operate in the US, but yet in 2003, the top 3 brands (Anheuser-Busch, Miller, and Coors) accounted for 82% of the market (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_in_the_United_States#Beer_and_society).  Not only are these brands crap (the light versions, that is, which are so heavily and successfully marketed), they are identical crap. On Penn and Teller's BullSh!t, those who claimed one of the 3 (Bud Lt, Miller Lt, and Coors Lt.) as their ""favorite beer"" could not identify it in a blind taste test. 
<b>The only tangible advantage big business has is the sense that they're successful and have a reason that success. That's like saying ""successful businesses have an advantage over unsuccessful businesses, insofar as they're more successful."" </b> 
No, the tangible advantage is that from their success they have ridiculous power, both in terms of financial stability and brand management. 
<b>Corporations always want to appeal to three things. The stock holders, their employees, and their customers. This is the break down of the profit motive.</b>
As such, they are willing to break the law so long as there is more financial incentive to break the law and pay a penalty for bad behavior than to not do so and lose out on potential profit. They care not for their effects on consumers, society, or the environment. They will try to make as much money as we possibly will let them. 
IMO we've let them go way too far. Oil companies, pharmaceuticals, and all the rest are taking advantage of the consumer and of America. It's tragic that we've gotten to this point, but I don't believe you're right that legislation will stop them. They ignore current legislation because they make more money by ignoring it than by following the law. Until they're held accountable for their effects on the population, they will continue to reap power from the people.",4.0
158,./to_process\debate.show.Are_big_corporations_good_or_bad_lj.xml,Are big corporations good or bad?,"1. You have rather strange ideas about advertising, ideas which aren't even held by those practicing your Capitalistic ideals. Wal-Mart and other national and international chains would probably disagree with you when you state the following:
""In fact, the only benefit Wal-mart has in advertisement is that it's on a national scale. That kind of advertisement would be useless to a local business that only really requires fliers and a newspaper spot.""
This is curious; seeing as you seem to miss the fundamentals behind the business. You see, national advertising doesn't matter to local businesses when the advertiser is, say, a national mail-order catalog or internet business. 
However, because Wal-Marts sell locally they are advertising locally, nationally. In other words; they are advertising to thousands of local communities at the same time, on a national scale. They are also using advertising mechanisms which are far more powerful than anything a small business can compete with. 
Wal-Mart also has the advantage of the rather mobile population it serves. If you live near or in any major or moderate (even many small) population centers you are near a Wal-Mart, it is familiar to you. All of the small, local businesses in the area are unknown. Most people, of course, go to familiar places. The effect is rather obvious; people are habituated into going to Wal-Mart because of familiarity, branding, and the tendency of these and other machinations to push small businesses out of the market. 
Small businesses are left with newspapers, fliers, small signs, canvassing, and (sometimes) small television spots. In the market, though, these are like taking B.B. guns to a nuclear war. The sophistication and reach of the national brands is spectacular and compounding; I can't believe this concept is lost on you. 
2. There are large, gaping, fundamental holes in your consumerist logic. The following statement is rather telling in both what it implies and what it leaves out:
""As I said, ultimately the consumer decides, and they in the mass, always decide toward the company that gives the best quality and quantity for the least cost (which is usually the larger businesses). This is the nature of competition, and very basic economic theory.""
Not only is it well established that logic and reason have little to do with the bulk of purchases (if it did we'd see the entire advertising industry bankrupted); you are leaving out values beyond simple price vis a vis quantity. Things cost more than their price and most people don't factor in the social, environmental, and ""economic"" cost of purchasing a particular good or service. 
Lemme' give you some info you knock out your logical consumer theory:
<a href='http://www.smartmoney.com/theproshop/index.cfm?story=20070322'>http://www.smartmoney.com/theproshop/index.cfm?story=20070322</a>
<a href='http://www.nationalbusiness.org/NBAWEB/Newsletter2005/1099.htm'>http://www.nationalbusiness.org/NBAWEB/Newsletter2005/1099.htm</a>
It's always funny to me that you have to use biased sources from your side to back up your arguments while I can find sources from your own side to back me up.
People are not going for the best quality versus cost, some might, but quality is extremely subjective anyways. People regularly buy cigarettes, drugs, alcohol, fattening food, as I said before they'd buy poison if the price was right. (and they used to, before the FDA was a working organization..well...I mean...we still do.). We buy harmful materials, consume them, and allow them to kill us for seconds of pleasure; not entirely logical, is it? 
People will buy houses without any money; they'll choose gambling over the electricity bill, they'll choose meth over food. Where is your logical consumer? I am still trying to find this most mythical of beasts.
3. What Wal-Mart did was a good thing, though they supported and continue to support the political administration that caused such a tremendous screw-up. 
The government is perfectly capable of doing what Wal-Mart did, for free (it made a profit from its activities, after all). What Wal-Mart did was not a result of market forces, though, according to this study:
<a href='http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Insurance/InsureYourHome/'>http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Insurance/InsureYourHome/</a>
RealKatrinaHeroWalMartStudySays.aspx
It was local and it had the resources to act; we could just as easily have a government entity run on a decentralized plan (such as the successful coast guard depicted in the story) than a for-profit company that still does more harm than good (they, again, helped put us in that position in the first place). 
To sum up, small businesses may not be able to handle regional disasters (though they could if they coordinated under a larger entity); we have a Federal Government which is supposed to do that. Unfortunately, because of the influence of businesses like Wal-Mart we have conservative, anti-government politicians who utterly ruin our government's ability to function. 
By the way, I live in the State of Missouri, a state (along with Iowa, Illinois, and others) being hit by the recent flooding of the Mississippi. The government has performed well; we havn't seen half the damage since the government-built levees were constructed after the great flood of 93'. It's a wonderful counter-example of how government (a cooperation of State, local, and Federal) can fix problems and saves lives/property. 
4. ""Hopefully not without suing the making for fraud.""
It's hard to sue after you're dead. It's also hard to sue with a weak government and a low-paid lawyer backing you up against a billion-dollar company and its cadre of high-priced lawyers. 
5. I've already established that when large-scale businesses take over a given market ingenuity slows. Ideas that small businesses had that could improve our lives would be lost when they go under. 
You also can't actually believe that people are making the best possible decisions when it comes to purchasing. Only if people knew every single one of the choices available to them, were able to carefully weigh each one, and then make a decision could you even plausibly say that. We all know that that is completely impossible.
What's strange to me is that you aren't worried about the problem of corporate domination from a Libertarian perspective. Did you not notice that the result of big corporations knocking down small businesses you'll see an ever-decreasing number of entrepreneurs, small property and capital owners? Essentially, you are supporting the elimination of individual private property for corporate private property; where most land and business is owned by a few large corporations. 
Besides that effect, we also have the internally destructive effect of non-productive culture. Because Wal-Mart and the like sell mostly foreign made, cheap goods they not only destroy small businesses locally but destroy domestic manufacturing nationally. 
Our goods cannot compete, price-wise, with goods from slave, sweatshop, and child-labor from overseas. As a result, we see more and more factories close down, more and more people needing cheaper goods, which means more shopping at Wal-Mart, which means even less demand for domestic goods and so on and so forth. 
All the while the money is being taken out of our local communities and sent to the HQs of the corporate behemoths and the piggy-banks of their CEOs. 
That billion-dollar account a Wal-Mart exec has could be a few thousand dollars in thousands to millions of people's accounts spread out across the country. (again, with all of this money moving out of the community there is even less to spend on small businesses nearby). 
But oh, they are ruining our economy, sending millions of people into poverty, supporting and expanding child-labor, and putting into power corrupt and inept politicians with their campaign contributions but at least they helped some people (for a profit) during hurricane Katrina. 
6. Well I am glad you admit the market shouldn't decide everything. 
7. ""Since that time government has only grown bigger and bigger, with devastating effects.""
It seems that the larger the government grows the larger our economy. At the very least the massive growth in our government's size since WWII hasn't stopped phenomenal economic development in the United States and Western Europe. But let's not get muddied with facts. 
First off; your explanation for the great Depression is nauseatingly simplistic and baffling inept. ""There was a run on the bank and the Fed didn't print money to save the economy...somehow"".
Really, that simple? There was a massive, random run on the bank due to what? Just A BANK? Have you been paying attention in your history classes sweetheart? 
For one thing; the people that told the Fed to act so ridiculously were the people in charge of the economy, the capitalists. They didn't want government intervention in their affairs; they are the ones that told the Fed not to act. (but, again, it's 100% the government's fault..and not just the administration, the entire concept of government caused the Great Depression). 
Secondly, the run on the banks came from the panic, which followed on the heels of the Stock Market crash. 
Here's the thing, I've been reading up on where you got the monetarist explanation for the Great Depression. In fact; I am going to start a Great Depression thread on its own because this is a rather fascinating topic of discussion. 
I suppose we'll have to duke it out over here (once I've had the bloody time to research other parts of this debate):
<a href='http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/What_Caused_the_Great_Depression_(Mostly'>http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                       What_Caused_the_Great_Depression_(Mostly) </a>)
8. For one, the fact remains that there is a creative stifling effect in large companies; I didn't say that it was impossible to overcome; but it is a major problem. That was my whole bloody point. I also didn't say large companies don't innovate, they just innovate at a much slower rate than smaller companies...but no matter to you. You can just make up my arguments as you go along.
The article, in its first three paragraphs, states exactly this. It indicates that such stifling tendencies are possible to overcome, but it recognizes the problem I identified (while you pretend it doesn't exist.)
The rest of this is going to have to be completed later or in other debates. I don't have the time to finish at this point. It's midnight already and I need to work in the morning. Didn't want to leave you hanging though; it'd be cruel to withhold fresh meat from a starving dog.","<b>However, because Wal-Marts sell locally they are advertising locally, nationally. In other words; they are advertising to thousands of local communities at the same time, on a national scale. They are also using advertising mechanisms which are far more powerful than anything a small business can compete with.</b>
The point I was making, and think I made, was that their advertisement advantage is not that much greater because though their message reaches a greater audience, it reaches in practical terms, the same audience locally as a local business can. You also give me the impression t hat you believe humans are very naive. Wal-mart has a higher budget, for sure, but fundamentally people respond to substance and not flashy lights. You haven't been tricked by the green screens and CGI, and using you as a high bar for nativity, I believe the average Joe sees through it too.
Either way, your point on advertisement doesn't have any merit, for it doesn't drain business in a way that is measurable -- at least in theory: Wal-mart has a larger supply then a local business, thus their ad budget is proportionate. In my town there are numerous stores that have no TV advertisement whatsoever, and they operate at full production. This is all kind of a silly thing to argue over, because ultimately Wal-mart has the right to obligation to advertise at full strength, and if a store or two goes-under because of it then they should take responsibility for not getting the word out that their prices are lower etc. This seems terribly unlikely though.
<b>All of the small, local businesses in the area are unknown.</b>
Evidently the word ""local"" escapes you. To help you understand, foreign is it's antonym. You're really stretching to make your argument. Towns and cities depend on local business, and it therefore perplexes me that this whole time they haven't been able to find them.
<b>The sophistication and reach of the national brands is spectacular and compounding; I can't believe this concept is lost on you.</b>
Even if this were super relevant on a micro scale, many of the local businesses in my area are franchises. They might sell cars or food, but they get the luxury of selling recognized brands. Come to think of it, the tiny general store I bike to sells recognized brands too.
<b>Not only is it well established that logic and reason have little to do with the bulk of purchases (if it did we'd see the entire advertising industry bankrupted); you are leaving out values beyond simple price vis a vis quantity. Things cost more than their price and most people don't factor in the social, environmental, and ""economic"" cost of purchasing a particular good or service.</b>
Sure, people impulse buy. They also don't always acts rationally like the game theorists would like. However, I don't consider them imbeciles. I think the consumer will make their own decision and that the emergent effect will be rational, i.e. with what the market predicts. At least that's what history has shown. 
Those two links you give me are rather laughable. The first illustrates the well known phenomenon of impulse buying, which the evolutionary psychologists predicted long before that particular study was released. However, chocolates is a rather dubious thing to use. I suspect the the same facts aren't as true for buying a new car, house, computer, furnace, or anything else of considerable cost.
These are the heaviest attacks against capitalism you can make? It seems like nit picking when compared to the big picture. That big picture being the huge successes of capitalism and privatization to raise people out of poverty and let them lead a better life. The welfare state of the socialists is infeasible on a micro psychological scale, as well as on the macro economic scale. And without offering an alternative?
<b>It's always funny to me that you have to use biased sources from your side to back up your arguments while I can find sources from your own side to back me up.</b>
I'll ignore the paradox in that. The red herring should not be ignored. In fact, it should be underlined. My sources are scholarly and empirical. The ideology associated with them is by in large irrelevant to the facts they lay out. Instead of attacking the man, attack the facts, so long as you want to remain logically cohesive.
<b>People regularly buy cigarettes, drugs, alcohol, fattening food, as I said before they'd buy poison if the price was right.

No it isn't. That why I don't do any drugs myself, and take medication only as a last resort. However, I would never advocate telling a person what he or she should do with their body. People have a personal responsibility and that is their main prerogative. I actually do not support the war on drugs at all, and favour complete legalization. Same with foods. So long as it is advertised that food X contains unhealthy fats, then it is up to the individual to decide whether she wants X or Y. It's called freedom. 
<b>People will buy houses without any money; they'll choose gambling over the electricity bill, they'll choose meth over food. Where is your logical consumer?</b>
The meth addicts and the people directly effected by the housing crisis are a minority. Even so, capitalism is a system that gives a person the capacity for success. Likewise, it will give them a capacity for failure. I think that it is elementary of a free society that a person should fail if they do things that are risky or stupid. Luckily for them, in a capitalist society the wealth of all classes, poor included, increases incrementally. 
<b>It was local and it had the resources to act; we could just as easily have a government entity run on a decentralized plan (such as the successful coast guard depicted in the story) than a for-profit company that still does more harm than good (they, again, helped put us in that position in the first place).</b>
Um... again the links you cite in support of your argument come to the opposite conclusion. :P 
From the article: ""It's not the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A new study suggests Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Lowe's would be a lot more helpful. 
Examining federal and private responses to Hurricane Katrina, the study says why FEMA was destined to fail and why for-profit companies succeeded at disaster recovery.""
Also notice that when it mentions the Coast Guard (which is like a police or military service and therefore, in my opinion, should be governmental) it says ""It also looks at the Coast Guard -- the <i>only</i> federal agency lauded for its Katrina performance...""
""Profit-seeking firms beat most of the government to the scene and provided more effectively the supplies needed for the immediate survival of a population cut off from life's most basic necessities,"" Horwitz wrote in the study.
I don't doubt that the state can help, like it did in Missouri. I am not an anarchist. I'm just a capitalist. Nevertheless, I find it ironic that you use levees as a pro after mentioning Hurricane Katrina. I think in many cases, private industry can do a better job than government bureaus. I don't think the government is completely inept. Levees in your area apparently did their job. I simply will say that private industry does a much better job. Like Horowitz says in the link you gave: """"Disaster response happens at the local level,"" Horwitz said. ""FEMA is not local to anyone except people who live in Washington, D.C."" And like Friedman explains, when talking about how private enterprise can fix Central Park: <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PaN9M4WwHw'>2:05</a>
<b>It's hard to sue after you're dead. It's also hard to sue with a weak government and a low-paid lawyer backing you up against a billion-dollar company and its cadre of high-priced lawyers.</b>
It's called tort law. 
<b>I've already established that when large-scale businesses take over a given market ingenuity slows.</b> 
When? The link you gave be earlier showed not that it slowed by that A) corporate bureaucracy helps innovation and B) innovation is best when it is innovative, like when Apple crossed into the digital music industry.
<b>Essentially, you are supporting the elimination of individual private property for corporate private property; where most land and business is owned by a few large corporations.</b>
You mean like the federal government? They own around 25% of the land in America. They should only own, in my opinion, the land that their government buildings are on. And corporate private property? In the first place, corporations, again, don't own anything. Stock holders, employees, customers, and a few executives own corporate land collectively. In the second place, the system that would allow your unfounded anxiety of corporately owned property is the system we are currently under. You are making a prediction of the effects of what I am advocating when what I am advocating is by in large currently in place. Your predictions still miss the mark! This proves once and for all that anti-capitalists can't see whats right in front of their eyes. The only changes in this regard that I favour is removing government from business. That in no way makes it easier for corporations or governments to control us as individuals. It makes it considerably harder, and considerably less profitable. Moreover, corporate welfare is not something any libertarian advocates. Libertarian free-market institutes like <a href='http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8230'>Cato</a>, for example, are vehemently against corporate welfare.
<b>All the while the money is being taken out of our local communities and sent to the HQs of the corporate behemoths and the piggy-banks of their CEOs.</b>
Such convoluted cynicism. ""The piggy-banks of their CEOs."" Give me a break. Most profit goes to the share holders, mutual funds and reinvestment. I challenge you to find me a single successful company that doesn't reinvest more than 80% of their profits.
<b>It seems that the larger the government grows the larger our economy. At the very least the massive growth in our government's size since WWII hasn't stopped phenomenal economic development in the United States and Western Europe.</b>

The Westbro Baptist Church is more like a cult rather then Christians because Christians wouldn't say that God hates gays. He hates the sin but not the sinner so what the people doing there are wrong and shouldn't be doing that. KKK weren't even Christian. Yes my family is Christian.

If those people actually looked at me today and see what I was doing they would know I would be a ""true Christian"" because I don't do what the secular world does and being a Christian isn't something that you just accept Christ and then do whatever you want.

Re-read my last statement. Your thinking about it backwards. It is the mothers choice whether or not they bring a child into this world. It's her body.

If it something that has an impact on my life, then I would not take it at face value. I would check to see if the results of the study have been peer reviewed, what methodologies were used, and if there were any other studies that confirmed or contradicted their findings. If it was something that has no impact on my life, then I would simply regard it as an interesting piece of information but remain somewhat agnostic on the results until further independent studies are done confirming the results. Keep in mind that not everything in a scientific journal is labeled as 100% conclusive fact. Scientific journals contain many studies that just show preliminary results and require further testing to draw a definitive conclusions. Many articles may just be a hypothesis a scientist has about something. Not everything in science is black and white with 100% conclusive results.

Good, but you seem to be the exception to the rule because many Christians do.
<b>Why do you use something you don't believe in attempt to prove your point.</b>
I already explained why, but I'll see if I can make it more clear. Since we both provided different definitions of faith we need to figure out which definition matches the context of this debate. Since this debate is about religious faith we should use the definition of faith that is tied to religion. The dictionary definition I provided matches the definition provided by your religious book, and the definition you provided does not. So since this is a debate about religious faith, we should use the definition that matches the religious defintion.
It seems pretty clear that you don't want me to use the Biblical definition because it agrees with the definition I used from the dictionary, and shows that faith and reason are not compatible. You would rather use a definition that doesn't match the context of the debate topic. Watch the first 30 seconds of the video in the description of the debate and tell me which of our definitions you think matches the context of the debate. 
Let's take a look at the definition you provided again. ""allegiance to duty or a person : loyalty."" Now lets plug the key words from your definition into the debate title. ""Are allegiance/loyalty and reason compatible?"" How does that debate topic make any sense using your definition? Allegianc and reason have absolutely nothing to do with each other.
<b>I asked this because you said,"" None of the words in the Biblical definition can be translated as ""allegiance"" to match your definition."" 
Allegiance: 2: devotion or loyalty to a person, group, or cause 
Since when has any religious person not a devotion to a cause?</b> 
I never said religious people are not devoted to a cause. I said the word ""allegiance"" doesn't match any of the words in the Biblical definition of faith. The two key words in the Biblical definition were ""confidence"" and ""assurance"". The word ""allegiance"" does not match either of those words. Let's compare the words, starting with ""confidence"".
Allegiance: Devotion or loyalty to a person, group, or cause. <a href='http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/allegiance'>http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/allegiance </a>
Confidence: A relation of trust or intimacy; the quality or state of being certain <a href='http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/confidence'>http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/confidence </a>
I think the key word in the definition of confidence is ""trust"". Let me know if you disagree. Trust is not the same as devotion or loyalty. I can trust someone without being loyal or devoted to them, so those words are not synonymous. 
Now let's compare ""allegiance"" with ""assurance"".
Assurance: The state of being assured.
Assured: Characterized by certainty or security
I can be certain of something without being loyal or devoted to it. Again, the words are not synonymous.
<b>Why do you not treat the Bible in the same regards. It may only a hypothesis or any range up to 100% It is you that makes the Bible more creditable by using it.</b>
That is how I treat it, but that is not how most Christians treat it. They base their lives around what it says and try to force other people to obey what it says.

A progressive tax gives incentive to donating to charities, and although I wish it wasn't the case, a lot of wealthy people only donate for the sake of those tax breaks. Does that make their donations selfish? Yes. Do I think it matters? No. What difference does it make if a cure to AIDS is found because Bill Gates donated money for a tax break? Do you think the millions of people that have AIDS care? Does it matter if Bill Gates gives computers to schools in order to get a tax break?
We don't live in an ideal world. Sure, it would be better if we could create a flat tax system which neither the poor pay too much, or the rich pays too little. I believe Alex Smith said it best, 
""The necessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor. They find it difficult to get food, and the greater part of their little revenue is spent in getting it. The luxuries and vanities of life occasion the principal expense of the rich, and a magnificent house embellishes and sets off to the best advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which they possess. A tax upon house-rents, therefore, would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be anything very unreasonable. It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion.""","I know I said the previous statement was my final question but there is a obvious a difference of opinion on taxes and donating.
<b>Does that make their donations selfish? Yes. Do I think it matters? No</b>
To me, it does matter because the only reason people donate is due to their own selfish wants and needs. 
Finally, what about tax loopholes under the most complex progressive tax in the world?
Top 10 Examples of Progressive Tax Loopholes. [1] If the rich have the ability to pay, you noted that then they should pay. Billions of dollars of taxes are lost due to loopholes and they are not even donating.
On the other hand, in a flat tax, it would be different. ""One low income tax rate paid by all but the poorest wage-earners, who are exempt. No loopholes for the rich to exploit. No graduated rates that take a higher percentage of income from people who work hard to earn more. No need for a huge bureaucracy to police fiendishly complex tax laws.""

I changed it to this, the weapon isn't dangerous because it can't do harm but the act of using the weapon is because that's really the only place anything can be done. in an act.

I'm saying that any reasoning to why something is dangerous can be good reasoning, of course there is bot only <i>how something is dangerous</i> but <i>how dangerous something is</i> a pencil can be a dangerous thing, but not nearly as dangerous as a gun. You can redefign your opinion of dangerous as simply anything that has the intent to hurt you, or simply acts themselves. All you are doing is excluding one qualifier of <i>dangerous</i> for absolutely no reason. I don't lack a reason to consider guns dangerous since they make others dangerous makes themselves dangerous. That qualifier of <i>dangerous</i> is a reason in itself, and I haven't heard a good reason for it to not be considered a good reason.

It can sometimes be the person, object, <i>and</i> the act. Sometimes just one, or just two, you can measure danger by how much.

Drawing with a pencil isn't dangerous, unless its a baby drawing, however your opinion that a baby is dangerous may radically change if it lacks possession of a pencil. A person isn't necessarily dangerous without a weapon. So does that mean I can say no being is ever dangerous and only objects are dangerous? Since the amount of <i>dangerous</i> a criminal is changes when he lacks or possesses a gun, however the criminal is still dangerous.

Although the object can be used as a dangerous one, anything can. The main reason I rest on this side is because I don't want to say everything is dangerous, but since anything can be used dangerously, everything must be.
<b>Dangerous is subjective meaning that you can argue anything is dangerous</b>
True, all too true. I feel that the simple fact that the object on it's own can't do harm, makes it not dangerous. You feel that if the object has potential to do harm it's dangerous, but not that everything is dangerous.

Actions are dangerous because that's where any harm can occur. I feel the things can't be dangerous just because they make others dangerous because anything can make someone more dangerous. In fact everything does, just in way varying degrees. A man with a teddy bear is more dangerous than a man without just as a man with a gun is more dangerous than a man with a teddy bear.
<b>I say no because it isn't dangerous enough for me to personally consider it dangerous.</b>
It seems that it's not whether or not they are dangerous is actually our argument, but instead it's a thresh hold for us.
I set my thresh hold at 0% since I believe objects don't do harm alone.
You set yours at death or serious injury, which is why you say a pencil isn't dangerous, but agree that a baby with a pencil is dangerous.
<b>And I'm being specific that things can be indirectly dangerous, or directly dangerous. It seems to you that things are only dangerous or not dangerous, there is no indirect.</b>
Yes, basically I'd rather not go into indirects again for all the possibilities like pencils with babies, or elderly with dry foods.

In birds where mortality rates are pretty bad, ""gay"" traits have been known to show themselves. The male birds that are born later will not go out and find mates, but stay home with the sisters and help raise their babies.

I meant in government. I stand by that. If you look at impoverished states like Burma, you will see that the needs of the people are ignored, and those who care (Aung San Suu Kyi) are silenced. This is what society was like before mass wealth. 
<b>Humans haven't drastically changed through their later evolution</b>
Precisely my point. The change is that people who <i>have</i> humanitarian views are no longer killed or imprisoned (at least in the west they aren't). Conversely, in the poorer regions of the world, human rights are severely diminished, with countless abuses and inequalities. Here in the west, where we can easily feed people and in all ways provide for them, it is possible to give everybody rights. As I said, before industrialism increased supply, most people were essentially slaves who were forced to work to provide for the aristocracy. Now that machines can do it, those in power can afford to allow liberty.

<b>Rhetorical question, we can look back to history for profound ideas related to every subject matter, not just conflict.</b>
All of life is conflict. What lessons are there to learn from anything that could not be defined as a conflict? Women's rights, rapid industrialisation, religion - all conflict in one form or another. 
<b>No, all wars are fought over power.</b>
Wealth and resources <i>are</i> power. Why do you think the U.S.A doesn't declare Iraq a dominion? Because they have what they wanted. Oil.

You clearly know little of war. Military power is but a means to an end; that end is wealth, or defence of wealth.

181,./to_process\debate.show.Are_live_debates_are_superior_to_written_debates_lj.xml,Are live debates superior to written debates?,"<i>First Proposition</i>
I contend that they frequently don't - my evidence also being this site. The number of times I have checked someone's sources and found them to be terribly illegitimate, fallacious, or grossly misrepresented far exceeds that of when the source is credible. I have also only very rarely encountered anyone who has checked my own sources. Given that the majority of debaters themselves are not checking their own sources or those of their opponent, I think it is a very safe conclusion that very, very few observers ever check even some of the sources being cited. There is absolutely no basis to claim that more observers of written debate source check than those observing a live debate, particularly given the prevalence of smart phones for live fact checking.
<i>Second Proposition</i>
Regarding your second proposition, easier does not necessarily make for a better debate or audience experience. The delay in exchanges arguably discourages the following of written debates to begin with, and the more an individual debater is actually gathering appropriate evidence the longer that debate is going to be protracted. By contrast, a live debate has immediate responses. The debaters largely do rely upon their memory; exercising and training recall, and breeding familiarity with key literature and research on a subject hardly seem like weaknesses to me. That live debate requires more effort is strongly indicative of a <i>better</i> debate for the audience and debaters, not a lesser one. 
Further, there is some capacity for live fact checking and research, again via smart phone technology. There is no reason that a wholly illegitimate source should fly under the radar, particularly as a well-researched debater will be familiar with the legitimate sources and a strange source should raise automatic flags. Lacking such live fact checking, it is entirely possible for a debater to include in their counter a note/flag for their audience that the source may not be legitimate and to challenge their opponent to elaborate upon the source further.","<i><b>that they frequently don't</b></i>
This would support my assertion rather than rebut it since all that is required is some.
<i><b>The number of times I have checked someone's sources and found them to be terribly illegitimate, fallacious, or grossly misrepresented far exceeds that of when the source is credible.</b></i>
This could also be true of live debates, but would only be known through investigation. It also does not rebut the first claim. I personally check other people's sources nearly always and always check my own sources before using them.

The debate format, and each debate which follows it, will have a subjective impact on its debaters and audience and I do not believe it possible to say that either format is objectively better at all times and for all participants.
<i><b>Your second proposition depends upon more than greater ability...</b></i>
I assume you only assert this as part of your argument that I am not arguing the objective merits. My second proposition is, in total, greater ability.
<i><b>As someone who has participated in live debates and who has actively called out my opponents on potentially illegitimate sources to great success, I heartily disagree.</b></i>
In my experience the success of live examination depends highly on the material being debated (and, of course, the skill of the debaters.)
<i><b>To an at least equitable extent, not much can be done about it in a written debate either.</b></i>
I think here is where we may have a genuine point of disagreement. In a written debate, the other party can request the source, examine it, and respond accordingly.
<i><b>By failing to demonstrate that written debate is objectively and demonstrably better at supporting source checking and argument verification, you have failed to prove the superiority of that medium to live debate.</b></i>
More time is objectively better than less time in the examination of source material.
<i><b>I have given you an analysis as to why live debate is capable of source checking</b></i>
Capable, but not equally capable. A live audience member needs to rely on memory, note taking, or live fact checking while the debate is in progress, whereas written debate allows thorough analysis in a longer time frame.",4.0
184,./to_process\debate.show.Are_live_debates_are_superior_to_written_debates_lj.xml,Are live debates superior to written debates?,"<b>First Proposition</b>
Your initial first proposition was only ""that there is at least some drive to check sources - i'll offer this site or any other written debate site as evidence."" My arguments pertaining to the prevalence of drive were in direct response to that, including my counter example of this forum. Do not insult my integrity on account of your ineptitude in defending your initial assertion. 
You now contend not that written debate is characterized by “some drive to check sources”, but that the drive is comparable for both mediums (a claim you justify not with any actual warrant but in the name of simplicity, but which I shall call either laziness or inability) and that it is the ability to exercise that drive which matters. This is a new argument under the first proposition, and far more closely related to the second where I will henceforth address it.
<b>Second Proposition</b>
Your second proposition has been that it is easier to be more thorough in fact/source/argument checking a written debate. This is an argument of ability. I group your modified observations off of the first proposition here, since they are now effectively the same argument.
You contend that because written debate occurs at the pace of the participants this makes them more able to fact/source/argument check. You have furnished no proof that the pace of a written debate compliments that of its observers. I contend that observers are perfectly capable of live debate source checking, and further note that most live debates are officially recorded (and all may be recorded by the observer) for later review. Further, I contend that in written debate the delay between responses actually discourages continued observance of the debate altogether; it is too <i>slow</i>. You end up with no external source or fact checking because you have no observers (or at the very best, far fewer). As mentioned previously, this is paired with a diminished capacity for internal fact and source checking due to the debaters' lesser familiarity with the subject in written debate.
You have additionally contended that: <i>In my experience the success of live examination depends highly on the material being debated (and, of course, the skill of the debaters.)& I think here is where we may have a genuine point of disagreement. In a written debate, the other party can request the source, examine it, and respond accordingly.</i>
The success of written examination depends highly on the material and skill of the debaters as well; no one is going to endure a protracted written debate or critically examine it if they are unfamiliar with the material, if the material is poorly presented, or the debaters inept. This is non-unique, and also a non-response to my point that debaters can call themselves out on sources at least as much as in written debate. For instance, in a live debate, the other party can also request the source, examine it, and respond accordingly. That is non-unique. What is different is that there is more pressure in a live debate to actually share the source, and less capacity to backtrack if caught off-guard when using illegitimate sources. Accountability is higher in live debate.
<i><b>Regarding the weighing criteria for this debate</b></i>
<b>Qualified Sense of Experience [and] “I have said twice now […] I do not believe it possible to say that either format is objectively better at all times and for all participants.”</b>
And as I have already said, this is a misrepresentation of my argument entirely. My point was that your “qualified sense of experience” assumes a number of things: (1) that ease of observance is a legitimate concern and criteria for assessing superiority of medium; and (2) that you have consistently assumed that your own preferences and abilities are reflective of the majority of observers in most circumstances.
The question is not one of universal superiority, but of probabilistic superiority. My arguments against the qualified sense of experience are that your standards for assessing that probable superiority are themselves potentially invalid assumptions; therefore unless you demonstrate their validity as criteria even winning an argument on them has no weight.","<u>First Proposition</u>
There is some drive to check sources.
Its relative preponderance in each medium is unimportant as to the claim as long at it exists for each. Surely you do not contend that <i><b>no one ever</b></i> desires to research the validity of claims made and their sources.
<i><b>This is a new argument under the first proposition</b></i>
The first was, and remains, only preamble for the second.
<u>Second Proposition</u>
<i><b>This is an argument of ability</b></i>
Ability within time. A debater with equivalent ability in all respects except source analysis within a short time frame is at a disadvantage in a live debate, but on equal footing in a written one.
<i><b>You have furnished no proof that the pace of a written debate compliments that of its observers.</b></i>
Is this something that needs proved? Do you not agree that the observer is generally not in control of the pace of a live debate?
<i><b>this is paired with a diminished capacity for internal fact and source checking due to the debaters' lesser familiarity with the subject in written debate.</b></i>
The debater's lesser familiarity may be more probable, but is not guaranteed. Additionally, the quality of the response by a debater with lesser familiarity may, with additional time, meet or exceed the quality of the response by a more familiar live debater. Moreover, the additional capacity for internal fact and referenced source checking is asserted to be conveyed upon the audience as well as the debater. 
<i><b>The success of written examination</b></i> and <i><b>debaters can call themselves out on sources at least as much as in written debate</b></i>
The success of any examination of novel material in some subjects may require time. In a written debate, taking 30 minutes to thoroughly review a source is generally trivial whereas it would nearly always be prohibitive within a live debate.
<i><b>I contend that observers are perfectly capable of live debate source checking</b></i>
Live debate source checking detracts attention from the ongoing debate; source checking within written debate allows the participant to do the analysis and resume in place.
<i><b>most live debates are officially recorded (and all may be recorded by the observer)</b></i>
If you want to assert that a live debate with good debaters which is posted freely as video and with a correct transcript is a really good thing for a majority of interested people a majority of the time, you will get no argument from me. However, I believe that to be a far more qualified assertion than one of objective medium superiority.
<i><b>I contend that in written debate the delay between responses actually discourages continued observance of the debate altogether;</b></i>
This is not a response to the added ability of those that <i>are</i> sufficiently interested and is just another in a myriad of factors that support the contention that the effect of the medium is a subjective one rather than one which can be proved objectively.
<i><b>there is more pressure in a live debate to actually share the source, and less capacity to backtrack if caught off-guard when using illegitimate sources. Accountability is higher in live debate.</b></i>
How's that?
<u>Subjective Expreience</u>
<i><b>(1) that ease of observance is a legitimate concern and criteria for assessing superiority of medium;</b></i>
Do you contend that it is not? No definition or restriction was given for ""superiority"", so I believe all attributes to be relevant to the discussion. 
<i><b>(2) that you have consistently assumed that your own preferences and abilities are reflective of the majority of observers in most circumstances.</b></i>
It does not need to reflect the majority in order to be true for some and make the question a subjective one.
<i><b>The question is not one of universal superiority, but of probabilistic superiority.</b></i>
I believe it to be more of a question of superiority for each individual at any given time. 
There are lots of reasons people will use to choose the venue of their debate. People just getting into debate, debaters with social phobias or speech impediments, debaters who normally participate in live debates but want to experiment with a line of reasoning, people looking to debate something at 3 in the morning, or with people in another country, etc., etc. may all decide that written debate is a better medium for any given instance.

Who says that? Evolution only argues that one's natural purpose is to pass one's genes down and to survive. If you can survive more so, and pass you genes down, then it doesn't matter if you kill everyone. 
<b>There is also no reason at all to think that enacting genocide would be in any way advantageous to individual reproduction.</b>
If you kill out those who have x trait, which is disadvantageous to the humanity, then it follows that it is moral for them to be exterminated.

Actually I did specifically address your Hitler/genocide point, and you never directly refuted it. You came back saying I was ignorant and then never took up the point in that thread again. 
I also did address the topic of determinism and free will with the technical and standard definitions provided by multiple sources. I clearly explained my reasons for ceasing that discussion with you, multiple times. 
<b>Who says that? Evolution only argues that one's natural purpose is to pass one's genes down and to survive. If you can survive more so, and pass you genes down, then it doesn't matter if you kill everyone.</b>
But you cannot survive and reproduce more by killing everyone.

Except that there is no proof that any genocide has actually ever been advantageous to humanity. In fact, the opposite is true.

neither sperm or egg have the capacity to become human <i>unless</i> they fuse together. They are half of a human being and will never grow to be human and are never human, but a foetus is human because it has the necessary prerequisites to be considered human.

I'll certainly entertain this argument. There is a difference between us and God- we can't create one hair on a child's body or a foetus from literal nothing, but God can, and because he can, he can abort as many babies as he wants.
<b>Or if you are a reasonable being you could realize that the determining factor is self-awareness and not what that thing will someday perhaps become</b>
Because we can't communicate with a foetus it isn't self aware. That's rubbish. Just because you can't speak to it doesn't make it unaware of what is happening around it. It is aware enough to collect the necessary nutrients to keep living, growing and specializing cells it needs for independent living. Anything that can do this is a little self aware. By your argument, people in a vegetative state are 'not aware' but yet we still feel the obligation to stick IV fluids in there arms and keep them alive.

Fact: At the point of conception the fetus has no more self awareness than the sperm or the egg individually, nor does it 3 to 6 months after that point. After six months it may have the self-awareness of an insect. 
So my analogy is factually correct. 
But you are not basing your idea on facts, which is fine, I'm happy to address your concerns as well,
you are using potential. You believe that thing, upon conception is meant to be. 
You've said so and I will show you where, but let's not gloss over exactly what you believe because I find it is helpful for individuals, like yourself, who have an invested ideological incentive to thoughtlessly defend an indefensible position.
You believe, literally, that of the millions of sperm in each ejaculation, and of the 300,000 eggs a woman has in her body, that those very two were meant to meet at that very time. Keep in mind all of the billions of people in the world as well. You believe that it was preordained for those two people to meet at exactly that time, have exactly that egg ovulating, and exactly that one sperm would win the race. 
This is your belief, there was no free will, you did not choose, you were controlled by some divine power to make it just so regardless of the astronomical odds. That is the only thing that ""<b>it is already meant to become and be treated as a human being</b>"" can ever mean.
It is important to describe this exactly because people who say this rarely or never think of the true implications of it. There is no other implication for the statement ""<b>it is already meant to become and be treated as a human being.</b>"" To be true there necessarily <i>cannot</i> be free will at all or choice at all.
But okay, that is what you believe. 
If that is the case, then the person who aborts also has no free will.
This too is necessarily true because every action has a reaction, and if all potential was ""<b>meant to become</b>"" then at some point an abortion which was <i>not</i> ""<b>meant to be</b>"" would result in a different child than would have been born, who'd consequently have different DNA, who'd consequently make different kids than were meant to be, 
etc, etc, etc,
This is not outlandish or silly. It is the <i>only</i> conclusion to your theory of ""<b>meant to become</b>,"" the only one.
If you have free will then humans are random and you <i>have to</i> measure life by self-awareness because everything else is too random to apply. 
If you do not have free will than humans are not random, in which case you are correct, but at the very same time you have no right to deny another an abortion because that too <i>has to be</i> in order for your own theory to work.
Logically, you prove my point.","<b>Fact: At the point of conception the fetus has no more self awareness than the sperm or the egg individually, nor does it 3 to 6 months after that point. After six months it may have the self-awareness of an insect.</b>

Yeah I'm sure its right. Let me ask you a question if it isn't human, what species is it.Is humanity now status that one obtains throughout achieving/having things that are either out of there reach/control. It reminds me of the racial comments the 'whites' used to pour out. Because Africans were black and wore practically no clothes they were subhuman- and now because a foetus doesn't have brain, it is also sub-human.
<b>I say it is not. I believe the point at which it should be treated with this integrity is the point at which it has feelings, self-awareness, consciousness.</b>
As far as I'm concerned a foetus is aware of its own existence because it is capable of organizing its cells and collecting the necessary nutrients for not only growth, but survival.
<b>Ah, so in your mind power has an inherent right to do with power what they please.</b>
Yes and no. It is not as if humanity is perfect, remember that most Gods in antiquity (yes its probably a gross generalization) only act this way when provoked. In all the historical cases I've read on still births or miscarriages where a God was involved, the soul of the unborn child gets repatriation after this dilemma. The personas of these Gods are not very bad- in fact they have all that power and answer to no one, so why give the soul of these babies heaven, or reincarnation or any form of repatriation to these children/parents. they have no obligation to and they still do it so they dont abuse there power like what you would like to believe.
<b>But those without power must be held to a higher standard of morality than those with power.</b>
No I am not holding human beings at a higher standard of morality- I do however think we lower our moral construct in order to find loopholes. This is why there is a yard stick for 'consciousness' when we cant even tell if someone is conscious or not when there in comatose. And I have a question- isn't to be conscious to be aware of ones surroundings? Are you aware during the first two years of life, during sleep, while under powerful anaesthesia? If you forfeit your consciousness, are you still human?
<b>By your logic then, if one is rich and powerful, and another is poor and has no power, that rich person should have more rights.</b>
They already do and are a determinant factor on whether the poor live or die, or if they get food, or money for an operation. What a grievance. And we have more power than a foetus and are the determinant factor on whether they live or die, or eat, or get to see the light of day, see a comparison?
<b>This is your logic, which is fine, religion is weird like that.</b>
In the three major world religions every God provides repatriation for those who are faithful, with a few exceptions.
<b>I believe if anything an all powerful being should be held to a higher standard of morality. If your god existed as you describe, this being should be despised in fact for abuse of that power.</b>
You probably didn't factor in the afterlife of the current day religions- In Hinduism, the baby is reincarnated as something else and Hindus are implored to treat animals with respect because there souls are human in essence. No harm done there i guess. In Christianity and Judaism, the one account of an abortion carried out by God ended up with child in heaven. That's better than Earth? So I'm guessing God was doing the baby a favour.
<b>But all of this is inconsequential to the subject of abortion because religion cannot be applied to legislation. It is unconstitutional and frankly stupid and backwards as you can plainly see simply by looking at nations who base law on religion presently and historically.</b>
If its inconsequential, then you shouldn't have brought it up.
<b>Your information is incorrect. We know when a foetus is somewhat conscious by the development of the brain, not by whether we can communicate, obviously.</b>
Yes and the development of the brain suggests further response to stimulus like heartbeat, movement in the stomach and response to pain or noise, which is a form of communication.
<b>Otherwise if doctors determine there is no hope for rehabilitation taking these people off of life support is in no way immoral.</b>
Doctors can't truly determine if someone will come out of a vegetative state and regain consciousness. However with a foetus they know that baby will receive a state of conscious in a few months. If a person in comatose would have woken up in a week, or a month, or three months is it morally just to take that person off life support? Doctors remove people off life support only because of lack of surety and foetus is not a case of lack of surety. 
<b>Your analogy is incorrect because that person has a developed brain which is capable of conscious, perhaps depending on level of vegetation. A foetus is not in any way capable of this. These parts of the brain do not yet exist.</b>
Yeah and the computer that is shut down with no way of communicating with the user and no clear signs of reboot is just as good as a brand new computer with its parts being assembled. Better yet, the second one has more value.
<b>Or if my mother would have had sex with my dad two days earlier or two days later it would have been a different batch of sperm and I'd not exist. Or if it were a different angle and a different sperm won the race I'd not exist. Or if they'd have never met. Or all of those scenarios for each of their parents, or each of those scenarios for each of their parent's parents, etc etc etc.</b>
You went way too much back in time. The determinant factor in your existence was already placed as a foundation- you were a foetus. You can't argue against that. Yes there were other factors that could stop you from <b>existing</b>, but you do realize that you had to go behind the point of conception to validate your point point of non-existence.

-Socrates","<b>Is it conciousness? If so, then are mentally illed, or people in coma considered as an animal? Is it physical structure? If so, then how do you explain bedridden people and senior citizens?</b>
Bedridden people and senior citizens are self aware. 
If you are trying in your simple way to say that ""if it is justifiable to abort a fetus for the reason it is not self-aware, then you would need to feel the same about one in a coma is is not self-aware"" 
You'd at least have a sensible argument, but it is still not the same because that person has the structure for self-awareness, and in most cases is to some degree conscious, even in a deep coma, and a fetus is missing the parts which would make this possible. So it is not the same in that way. 
But that is also ignoring the fact that we unplug people all of the time, and we do this based on the will of the individual if they left a will, and if not, it is the will of the family.
So applying your exact example to abortion, it would be the case where it was the will of the mother to ""unplug"" the one in a coma, if you are making that comparison.
Again though, it is not the same. In a coma you have the stuff that makes consciousness possible, a fetus does not have this.
<b>-The legallity of an action depends upon culture of the state. But there is only one rule for morality And that rule is to be followed by every citizen.</b>
Exactly. Which is why it is immoral for you to try to force your will on others. I'm glad you are now pro-choice.

<b>2. Abortion was legalized in 1973. And with abortion allowed, everyone believed that the unwanted children and the number of child abuse decrease, right?</b>

So annoying and dumb. 
I'm glad you at least realize that has nothing to do with why abortion was made legal. And that you also realize that link you sent is a religious looney propoganda piece with 0 basis in reality. It's nice to have someone who gets it on one of these debates.
<b>The legalization of abortion has not only increased crime, it also devalued human life and created a society corrupted of its morals (you can do more research if you want).</b>
lol, I know, that's just the kind of red herring a pro-life person would throw out then not back up with facts. Because they are totally wrong about it! Since there is absolutely no correlation. Great job anticipating a dumb argument someone might make. 
<b>It was never pointless to stand up for something that is right. But it is pointless to stand up for self centered reasonings</b>
Exactly. It is important we continue to stand up for women's right to choose because the alternative is more dead women and not a single extra fetus being born, and since that fetus has no feelings it is definitely the choice of the woman. It feels good to stand up for what's right. It's important these anti-abortion crazies aren't ever allowed to force their will on people again.

neither sperm or egg have the capacity to become human <i>unless</i> they fuse together. They are half of a human being and will never grow to be human and are never human, but a foetus is human because it has the necessary prerequisites to be considered human.
<b>And then you must logically stop petitioning humans to follow your odd dogma, and spend that time demanding god do so, since in these states god, via nature, aborts far more humans than have ever even been in the fetal state, in all of human history.</b>
I'll certainly entertain this argument. There is a difference between us and God- we can't create one hair on a child's body or a foetus from literal nothing, but God can, and because he can, he can abort as many babies as he wants.
<b>Or if you are a reasonable being you could realize that the determining factor is self-awareness and not what that thing will someday perhaps become</b>
Because we can't communicate with a foetus it isn't self aware. That's rubbish. Just because you can't speak to it doesn't make it unaware of what is happening around it. It is aware enough to collect the necessary nutrients to keep living, growing and specializing cells it needs for independent living. Anything that can do this is a little self aware. By your argument, people in a vegetative state are 'not aware' but yet we still feel the obligation to stick IV fluids in there arms and keep them alive.

A sperm is just the part of a man, an egg cell is the part of a woman. Losing them is just the same as losing blood.
But once they became together as one and fertilized to create a fetus, it is already meant to become and be treated as a human being. Funny how you guys give humanitary rights to animals but not among the humans who holds the future generation.
The carelessness of the parents is something that the baby is not meant to pay with their life. And Legal isn't always Moral","<b>But once they became together as one and fertilized to create a fetus, it is already meant to become and be treated as a human being.</b>
Fact: At the point of conception the fetus has no more self awareness than the sperm or the egg individually, nor does it 3 to 6 months after that point. After six months it may have the self-awareness of an insect. 
So my analogy is factually correct. 
But you are not basing your idea on facts, which is fine, I'm happy to address your concerns as well,
you are using potential. You believe that thing, upon conception is meant to be. 
You've said so and I will show you where, but let's not gloss over exactly what you believe because I find it is helpful for individuals, like yourself, who have an invested ideological incentive to thoughtlessly defend an indefensible position.
You believe, literally, that of the millions of sperm in each ejaculation, and of the 300,000 eggs a woman has in her body, that those very two were meant to meet at that very time. Keep in mind all of the billions of people in the world as well. You believe that it was preordained for those two people to meet at exactly that time, have exactly that egg ovulating, and exactly that one sperm would win the race. 
This is your belief, there was no free will, you did not choose, you were controlled by some divine power to make it just so regardless of the astronomical odds. That is the only thing that ""<b>it is already meant to become and be treated as a human being</b>"" can ever mean.
It is important to describe this exactly because people who say this rarely or never think of the true implications of it. There is no other implication for the statement ""<b>it is already meant to become and be treated as a human being.</b>"" To be true there necessarily <i>cannot</i> be free will at all or choice at all.
But okay, that is what you believe. 
If that is the case, then the person who aborts also has no free will.
This too is necessarily true because every action has a reaction, and if all potential was ""<b>meant to become</b>"" then at some point an abortion which was <i>not</i> ""<b>meant to be</b>"" would result in a different child than would have been born, who'd consequently have different DNA, who'd consequently make different kids than were meant to be, 
etc, etc, etc,
This is not outlandish or silly. It is the <i>only</i> conclusion to your theory of ""<b>meant to become</b>,"" the only one.
If you have free will then humans are random and you <i>have to</i> measure life by self-awareness because everything else is too random to apply. 
If you do not have free will than humans are not random, in which case you are correct, but at the very same time you have no right to deny another an abortion because that too <i>has to be</i> in order for your own theory to work.

-Socrates","<b>Is it conciousness? If so, then are mentally illed, or people in coma considered as an animal? Is it physical structure? If so, then how do you explain bedridden people and senior citizens?</b>
Bedridden people and senior citizens are self aware. 
If you are trying in your simple way to say that ""if it is justifiable to abort a fetus for the reason it is not self-aware, then you would need to feel the same about one in a coma is is not self-aware"" 
You'd at least have a sensible argument, but it is still not the same because that person has the structure for self-awareness, and in most cases is to some degree conscious, even in a deep coma, and a fetus is missing the parts which would make this possible. So it is not the same in that way. 
But that is also ignoring the fact that we unplug people all of the time, and we do this based on the will of the individual if they left a will, and if not, it is the will of the family.
So applying your exact example to abortion, it would be the case where it was the will of the mother to ""unplug"" the one in a coma, if you are making that comparison.
Again though, it is not the same. In a coma you have the stuff that makes consciousness possible, a fetus does not have this.
<b>-The legallity of an action depends upon culture of the state. But there is only one rule for morality And that rule is to be followed by every citizen.</b>

So annoying and dumb. 
I'm glad you at least realize that has nothing to do with why abortion was made legal. And that you also realize that link you sent is a religious looney propoganda piece with 0 basis in reality. It's nice to have someone who gets it on one of these debates.
<b>The legalization of abortion has not only increased crime, it also devalued human life and created a society corrupted of its morals (you can do more research if you want).</b>
lol, I know, that's just the kind of red herring a pro-life person would throw out then not back up with facts. Because they are totally wrong about it! Since there is absolutely no correlation. Great job anticipating a dumb argument someone might make. 
<b>It was never pointless to stand up for something that is right. But it is pointless to stand up for self centered reasonings</b>
Exactly. It is important we continue to stand up for women's right to choose because the alternative is more dead women and not a single extra fetus being born, and since that fetus has no feelings it is definitely the choice of the woman. It feels good to stand up for what's right. It's important these anti-abortion crazies aren't ever allowed to force their will on people again.

An agnostic athiest is an athiest that takes an agnostic position on god's existence, which is to say they don't assert to know. Think of the label like ""Liberal"" democrat or ""social"" conservative. The label serves as a clarification of the particular position you hold. And I don't see how the argument stands in light of the agnostic or even the ignostic athiest.

I have already presented the angnostic model of atheism. They don't assert the existence nor non-existence of a diety. It is no a position of belief, it is the withholdal of judgement on the issue. The gnostic athiest may well fall into this straw man, but his agnostic and ignostic conterparts quite clearly don't.

Believe is simply the undertaking of a variable, while everyone undertakes one variable or the other, whether positive of negative: God exists or God does not exist. Atheism, therefore, negates the belief, which negates the positive position being believed, which means that one intrinsically must believe the other one: ""I believe that God does not exist"".
God either exists or does not exist; there is no in-between. One either believes that God exists or believes that God does not exist, whether that belief is backed up with evidence or not, which means regardless of whether one is actively or passively holding to the opinion. Therefore, if one does not believe X, then one is saying that they do not believe the positive position of X.

50,./to_process\debate.show.A_proper_debate_for_the_existence_of_God_lj.xml,A proper debate for the existence of God,"This is a copy and paste argument I wrote quitesome time ago, it represents a creator God but not neccesarily an involved one.
(This is a response to an argument made by someone that God is not the creator of the universe, due to the Omniverse theory)
This particular topic was one which I had a really hard time with when I was not a believer as I could not find any other logical solution to this very issue, and as such I shall now expand upon that initial thought process which is more or less a more wordy form of the Cosmological argument.
Now to begin with we must first look at the issue of a single universe (ours). Now the idea is that there was no such thing as time before the big bang which of course makes sense, just as one could say that there are no timings before a race because the stopwatch has not been started yet. Now the issue I have with this is the fact that matter is a physical element and is thus subject to time and it would also need some method of creation, namely forces. So what we get is a situation where time is dependant on the matter to begin and vice versa. Then we also have the forces which are dependant themselves on matter to exist and the matter would need the extreme forces to exist (assuming that is how they are created according to the theory). So if we look at the analogy of the race we have a three way paradox in that the stopwatch cannot begin until all of the swimmers are at the blocks and the swimmers cannot get to the blocks because (in this case) there is no existence before the stopwatch begins. On top of this the starter’s gun cannot fire until all of the swimmers are at the blocks and at the ready and likewise the swimmers cannot start the race until the starters gun has fired. So what this means is that the swimmers would all have to be put into their positions all at the exact same time that the starter’s gun and the stopwatch go off. These both in terms of the analogy and reality are completely impossible.
There is however a theory known as the “pop” theory which more or less means that matter can pop into being from nothing aka has no cause. This is impossible on both logical and rational levels because matter, as a physical element, must have a cause. It would be like saying a table has no cause which is clearly nonsensical as it must be made before it can be a table. However on top of this there is no evidence to show that matter just appears out of nowhere. Also if matter just pops into existence without a cause then in reality there should be nothing that governs how or in what quantity it comes into being. Assuming this, then the moment the universe began it should have instantly filled up with new matter and thus the universe should be one infinite block of compact matter with no room for anti-matter etc. Now as a final point if pop theory is indeed true then if a physical element can pop into existence without cause then it would be likewise possible for a non-physical being to be uncaused.
Now what we call the universe is merely the perimeter with which matter is pushing it out, just as a balloon grows as the air molecules push against the sides of the balloon. We must assume that as matter does not exist outside of these universal “bubbles” that space is indeed a necessary property with which to create matter. In terms of our analogy space would be the pool. This adds another element to the issue in that the swimmers would need to be in the water already, but the pool needs to be filled with water by the swimmers. However the swimmers cannot fill the pool as time does not exist. So in other words they would need to fill the pool, be at the blocks and start the race all at the exact same time as the stopwatch is started and the starter’s gun goes off. If this point is argued against by saying that space is not dependant upon matter’s existence then the concept of an “Expanding universe” is illogical as the universe would already be infinite. As well as this the idea of an omniverse would also be impossible as it would all be one universe, just spaced apart like our galaxies are. 
Now to deal with the Omniverse theory itself. The basic idea is that the Omniverse is an infinite expanse of universes that can give birth to new universes. This is based on the idea of two universes “touching” each other, the force of which would initiate a big bang. Now the issue with this is that a universe cannot touch another universe if that other universe does not exist. As mentioned earlier the universe is dependant on the matter to exist and so on so forth. This means that a separate universe could not start another universe as there is no other universe to be started. In terms of the analogy think of the separate universe as being a helper who pushes you off of the blocks as you start to give you extra force, however they cannot push you off until the pool is filled. 
The only possibility then is if the other universe starts off another universe by fulfilling all of these factors meaning that it would have to split off from the main universe much like bacteria. The issue with this is that this is not a violent process and would not initiate a big bang as the matter is already within the space that has separated. But assuming that it did create a big bang then that particular universe would have to be immensely huge to be able to start a new universe with as much matter as ours. Another issue with this however is the problem that if it can split off then so should ours, and we should be creating more and more universes just as it would, meaning that eventually our universe would have petered out into nothing and we would essentially have in the end an omniverse full of single atoms. 
However the only way the Omniverse theory could be feasible as a creator is if it is infinite. Now this is impossible as matter can degenerate which means that on an infinite scale the omniverse should have either expanded out and eventually dissipated into nothingness or fallen back in upon itself due to gravitational pull and been destroyed (assuming there is gravitational pull between them which there shouldn’t be because the forces would be limited to the matter which are limited to the universe, just as a starter’s gun cannot be used to start a race the next town over). 
So as a result of the above statements we must conclude that there was indeed time before the big bang, just in another universe or dimension. Now these times themselves are dependant on the times of their creator universe, resulting in an infinite regression. However the Omniverse cannot be infinite due to the aforementioned points so eventually there must be a point of origin. This point of origin is in the exact same position as our universe, just several steps back and with nothing to appeal to.
This leaves us with only one rational option. That is that there is another separate universe/dimension that is not physical in nature (heaven) which was created by an uncaused entity that is also not physical in nature (God). This uncaused entity would have to be immensely powerful (Omnipotent) and not subject to physical laws such as time (Omnipresent). This being would thus be able to create space and matter at exactly the same time using its immense power (forces) and Omnipresence which in turn would start the universe.","<b> Now to begin with we must first look at the issue of a single universe (ours). Now the idea is that there was no such thing as time before the big bang which of course makes sense, just as one could say that there are no timings before a race because the stopwatch has not been started yet.</b>
Actually I have to admit the Big Bang might not have necessarily been the origin of time, nor the origin of existence. The origin of the universe? Yes, in a similiar sense that the origin of a rock was natural force, referring to the existence of its form rather than the existence of all the parts that made it. Before the big bang everything did exist as a singularity (which may mean time Still existed). The analogy is wrong because with the race time didn't literally start when the race did, the particular measurement of time did, the analogy comparing the race with the universe would merely show how the formation of the universe has a time span but not beginning of time itself. I don't know if this is going to help or hurt my case but I don't think the big bang was the beginning of time necessarily. There is also the cycle theory where we are going through a cycle of crunches and bangs. The big crunch theory is contained inside this theory, the big crunch theory would be... Think of the big bang, but backwards call this the normal flow of time at the end of time... Basically the universe becoming a singularity again. 
<b> Now the issue I have with this is the fact that matter is a physical element and is thus subject to time and it would also need some method of creation, namely forces. So what we get is a situation where time is dependant on the matter to begin and vice versa. Then we also have the forces which are dependant themselves on matter to exist and the matter would need the extreme forces to exist (assuming that is how they are created according to the theory). So if we look at the analogy of the race we have a three way paradox in that the stopwatch cannot begin until all of the swimmers are at the blocks and the swimmers cannot get to the blocks because (in this case) there is no existence before the stopwatch begins. On top of this the starter’s gun cannot fire until all of the swimmers are at the blocks and at the ready and likewise the swimmers cannot start the race until the starters gun has fired. So what this means is that the swimmers would all have to be put into their positions all at the exact same time that the starter’s gun and the stopwatch go off. These both in terms of the analogy and reality are completely impossible</b>
That is because the big bang wasn't the beginning of time, merely the beginning of the universe's formation lifespan. Just like with the race, your analogy is flawed. 
<b> There is however a theory known as the “pop” theory which more or less means that matter can pop into being from nothing aka has no cause. This is impossible on both logical and rational levels because matter, as a physical element, must have a cause. It would be like saying a table has no cause which is clearly nonsensical as it must be made before it can be a table. However on top of this there is no evidence to show that matter just appears out of nowhere. Also if matter just pops into existence without a cause then in reality there should be nothing that governs how or in what quantity it comes into being. Assuming this, then the moment the universe began it should have instantly filled up with new matter and thus the universe should be one infinite block of compact matter with no room for anti-matter etc. Now as a final point if pop theory is indeed true then if a physical element can pop into existence without cause then it would be likewise possible for a non-physical being to be uncaused.</b>
I don't know the credibility of that theory, it doesn't sound very credible. I don't necessarily think all matter existed eternally, but it makes just as much sense as a God does.

Well this is also based on your assumption of time being finite, being a conclusion of that analogy that I have argued is flawed. Also the universe's expansion (and I could be wrong) is merely meaning that all the matter, stars, galaxies, etc are moving outward into space. As well as the omniverse, we don't know if an omniverse exists, but maybe they could be different realms sort of idea. Maybe exist in different dimensions that never overlap.... Like planes.

First of all, I want you to be aware of my position concerning the debate of the theory of evolution. There are many evidences of many things in life. And that which one person infers as evidence of one thing is not necessarily and universally evidence of the same unto another person. Moreover, that which you have written of as evidence of evolution I find to be unconvincing. And likewise that, which I have written of I perceive is also unconvincing unto you. I am not interested in dissuading your position in regards to your conclusions. I am more interested in challenging what I think is axiomatic concerning the progenitors of the members of a species.
Axiom: a conclusion that needs no proof because its truth is obvious. (As used in Logic)
My axiom, simplified, is that a progenitor propagates progeny of its own species. Or one could also say that each species propagates its own species.
The definitions of the terms of my propositional axiom do not connote meanings that are specially defined. Example: Species A begets offspring of Species A. Man is born of man. Oranges are the fruit of Orange trees, etc.
What is your axiom? 
Our debate has now effectively been reduced to two conclusions; one is yours and the other mine. We can actually spare one another thousands of words of explanations by simply determining the root cause of our disagreement, so called. Take for example the following argument.
My argument: A is B, and B is D, therefore A is D. 
Your argument: A is not B, B is not D, and therfore A is not D. 
We can agree or disagree based upon the axiom. And the debate logically ends or begins thereby.
Let’s debate the axioms.","I would argue that the simplification of your axiom is at the root cause of the misunderstanding.
The label ""species"" is a completely arbritrary method of categorisation. Whilst a progenitor will of course immediately produce the same species, its offspring will not be genetically identical, and its the accumulation of these genetic differences that eventually cause a new species. I will try to be as simple and to the point with my initial argument as possible, as I feel your intepretation of my argument is entirely incorrect.
Let us label a progenitor at any stage of the evolutionary line as N. The offspring of a progenitor will be N+1. We can say both N is N+1 and N is not N+1 depending on our criteria of equality, in this debate the criteria being either the same species or genetically identical respectively. Whilst a parent and their offspring are the same species (N is N+1) they are NOT genetically identical (N is not N+1). I assume that you don't disagree with this point, but if you do than please say so. 
My argument (I will not call it an axiom), also simplified, is that an accumulation of genetic differences caused by random mutations means that whilst N is N+1 (using your equality criteria), it does not self evidently lead to the fact that N is N+<i>x</i> (<i>x</i> being any number of generations along the evolutionary tree), and that the chances of N not being N+<i>x</i> increases in probability the higher the value of <i>x</i> is.
Because the definition of a species is arbritrarily defined (simplistically) as a group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring, and as genetics provides the mechanisms for performing this functionality, it is not illogical to state that my criteria for equality has a direct baring on how your criteria for equality is measured. As in all cases my criteria for equality means that N is not N+1, and as the accumulation of my criteria has a direct effect on how your criteria is measured, it lends that this can lead to N is not N+<i>x</i>.
I did not call my argument an axiom as, according to your definition, it is something that requires no proof. I have clearly shown an alternative possibilty to your argument (as you have done to mine), therefore your axiom is not self evident and you are required to show evidence to back it up. I too must also bring evidence to the table to back up my argument. I'm afraid this will not be as simple for you as you first thought, as the debate does not logically end or begin based upon self evident axioms, but by differing arguments backed up by evidence. We've both stated our positions (neither or which are self evident, but both of which are possiblities), now let's debate both the arguments raised <b>and</b> the evidence to support those arguments.
So, if you wish to continue debating this, here is a bullet pointed list of some of the points that I will be making to back up my argument. You may rebute them as you see fit.
1. A parent and their child are never genetically identical.
2. Genetic mutations occur.
3. Some of these genetic mutations are beneficial to the organism.
4. As the definition of species is arbritrary, there is no natural force that limits genetic mutations to only those that would not affect the reproductive processes of an organism.
5. An accumulation of mutations that affect reproductive processes would eventually lead to an N+<i>x</i> that could not produce fertile offspring with N.
I feel I've adequately made my point, and shown your intitial axiom to not be as self evident as it would initial appear. I hope you too see that we will need to provide evidence to back up our positions (as neither is self evident). I look forward to a good debate.",4.0

Do you realise that most abortions (over ninety percent) occur before the foetus even has brain tissue? Think about that for a moment. Everything that makes us what we are comes from our brain, but what's aborted in the vast majority of cases has NO brain. In many cases what's aborted is a microscopic bit of cells. This isn't the same as killing infants or babies, so you need to learn more about it and divorce yourself from that mindset.",4.0

The exact definition of sapience is interestingly not needed to show that a fetus doesn't have it. it simply needs to be shown that sapience requires a well enough developed brain and that a fetus lacks a developed enough one and thus lacks sapience no matter what is to be said of further defining of the concept of sapience.

Dumpster babies have a level of self-awareness, as noted by their ability to respond to stimuli, that they have a nervous system, and that they have a memory. Sleeping babies are the same.
I personally approve of euthanasia for the severely mentally handicapped, and people who are in comas long enough that their recovery is nonexistent. Provided that the mentally handicapped are violent, and/or completely unable to function.
But this is all besides the point: laws are never consistent in their philosophy.
<b>which would be the same argument given stating that a fetus will eventually develop a brain and demonstrate sapience</b>
We don't base laws on the potential future ramifications of a choice. This is why disposing of a used condom isn't considered abortion, for example.

This is because sapience comes from the brain. If a foetus has none, it cannot be sapient. Sapience in this discussion is an umbrella word for independent thought, some level of consciousness, an ability to make decisions and so on.
We don't apply it to organisms with developed brains because those organisms are already capable of individuality. At this point, losing consciousness doesn't disqualify the individuality, unless the organism has transitioned into a state where they can not recover their consciousness, such as in a coma.

This is why abortion is made available. In those cases where a woman becomes pregnant, she can abort before the foetus is even a person, before it has a brain. By illegalising abortion, you remove a woman's right to abort the process that creates a human life, you force her to either have an illegal abortion, or to accept that pregnancy automatically leads to a human being born.
<b>In such a case we should just say we allow abortion because it suits us, not that it is allowed because of some philosophical system or principled decision.</b>

<b>I'll tell you this, if you find the answers for yourself... you'll not only see my point is valid but you will have a whole new appreciation for the applicability of the word in various situations.</b>
I'm well aware of how to use words in different situations. 'The caravan arrived at the city unmolested,' for example, means the caravan arrived undisturbed, not arrived un-sexually abused. 'The Rape of Nanking' doesn't refer to anyone actually physically inserting their penis into a city against the will of the city, it's just a play on words to illustrate the horror and depravity of what happened in Nanking. 
We can use words like this because it gets the point across and people still get what we mean when we talk like that. However, if you want to get extremely literal about this practice, you start to destroy the point of language by making everything too vague and ambiguous to be of any practical use. 
For example, one of the words used to define ""rape"" is ""violate."" If we consider every time anyone violates anything - a trespassing law, the trust of their friends, a contract, etc - legally the exact same thing as rape, our prisons would literally be packed to the ceiling with convicts. If you tried to claim a baby crying in a restaurant was molesting you because he was annoying you, technically, according to your subjective definition of the word, you're correct; you'd also look like a damn fool and nobody from the Supreme Court on up would take you seriously. 
The problem is you're working language backwards. Most people try to find a word that most clearly and accurately describes what they are trying to say. You're doing the exact opposite, finding words that can just barely by some stretch of the imagination be made to work in certain, specific circumstances.

2 Destroy the sleep or relaxation of.</i>
It fits perfectly. It doesn't need to be altered or bent, no part needs to be ignored or omitted for the entire definition of the word to seamlessly apply to the situations you are talking about. 
And if you had said ""abortions are a form of disturbing things"" nobody would be arguing with you.
But you went out of your way to choose a word with an overtly sexual definition, like rape. I can only assume this was to be inflammatory, which is why I argue with you now.

<b>KJV</b>","<b>Kol erets in the old testament is almost always local.</b>
Yes, but since the old testament is a collection of many manuscripts by different authors we should be analyzing the linguistics of each book individually. In Genesis the word erets is almost always translated ""earth"" and in most cases where it isn't translated as earth it's very obvious from the context that it's not referring to the earth. For example, <i>""the whole land (erets) of Ethiopia""</i> or <i>""the whole land (erets) of Havilah.""</i> If you go to <a href='http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?page=2&strongs;=H776#lexResults'>this site</a> and scroll down to the section titled ""Concordance Results using KJV"" it shows all the verses where the word <i>erets</i> is used. 
<b>ma‛al translated means upward.</b>
Yes, the verse I quoted actually has the word upward in it so I'm not sure what point you're trying to make with that.
<b>The word there is har which can mean hill</b>
The word <i>har</i> occurs 18 times in Genesis. 17 out of those 18 are translated <i>mountain</i> or <i>mount</i>. The one verse that is translated <i>hill</i> makes sense as <i>hill</i> because of the context. Here is the verse along with the one right after it that translates the same word as <i>mountain</i>. 
Genesis 7:
<i>19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills (har), that were under the whole heaven, were covered . 
20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail ; and the mountains (har) were covered.</i>
So if we translated <i>har</i> in verse 19 as <i>mountains</i> it would be redundant because of verse 20, and if we translate <i>har</i> in verse 20 as <i>hills</i> it would also make those verses redundant, which is why they translated the first one <i>hill</i> and the second one <i>mountain</i>. Plus the one in verse 19 is prefixed by the word ""<i>high</i>"", and saying <i>""high mountain""</i> would also be redundant because all mountains are high. The passage just describes the rising waters, first covering the high hills and then rising over the mountains.

The description of the flood makes it very clear that it was meant to be global by the excessive usage of phrases like ""all the people on earth"", ""end to all people"", ""destroy all life under the heaven"", ""every creature that has the breath of life in it"", ""Everything on earth will perish"", ""all life"", and ""destroy the earth."" I don't know how the author could make it any more clear. Think about it, if the author wanted to convey a global flood what more could he say other than all that? 
Another thing to consider is gods promise, ""Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.” If the flood was only a local flood then he has broken his promise many times because there are been many very large local floods.
I think you're grasping at straws trying to find some way to make the flood story about a local flood. Am I correct in assuming it's because you've discovered all the evidence that proves that there was no global flood and you're trying to find a way to make the flood story fit this evidence?",4.0

Do you see just how much you have to alter the story to fit a local flood?
For the sake of argument let's assume it was a local flood. Would you then agree that god lied when he promised he wouldn't flood the ""land"" again?
Would you also agree that nearly every verse in the story was translated incorrectly?","<b>You're picking one verse, taking it to its literal extreme and ignoring the complete context of the story and the book of Genesis as a whole.</b>
That is exactly what young earth creationist are doing since it would contradict psalm 104:9.
Also the flood account it appears to be from Noah's perspective also so that could be it. 
Also since it doesn't talk about mountain location it was probably refers to hills that the person (Noah) could see.

I agree that these symptoms are commonly encountered in pubescent children. However, note that these are also found in full grown adults as well as very little children. 
The issue is not so much about the alleged existence or non-existence of ADHD/ADD but rather about the true impact of the disorder on the individual everyday life. Perhaps it may be true that the disorder per say cannot be proven by for example say a lab analysis but we can very well demonstrate the effects on the individual: the child inability to learn, the adult difficulty in say keeping his assignments.

This argument actually almost stands. 
The difference stands first in the “effects”. If the <i>variation of personality</i> negatively impacts the person in his/her everyday life, then the <i>variation of personality</i> may be upgraded to a syndrome.

<b>If it can't be proven, we can't show that is has any effects. What you have described are therefore traits, not symptoms. </b>
The question of <i>proving the existence</i> is actually an interesting one.
 As side question to you: what sort of proof would you expect to demonstrate the existence of intangible things such “a thought”, “jealousy”, ”learning process”?
There are several approaches that can be used. We can use observations, deductions, analysis...
One can say “ if I can see it ,then it exists”. We know this can’t always constitute a proof (for example, a mirage). 
One can say “if I can’t touch it or measure it, it does not exists”. Then, how do we prove the existence of intangible things like “charisma” and human emotions?
These things do exist (at least the vast majority of us human agree that they do). Yet the only real way that their existence is demonstrated is through their “tangible” effects, through analysis, statistics, deduction.
In fact, this is the way scientific discovery is made. The proof is reasonably achieved through the process of observing the effects, noting the correlations, the similarities, gathering statistics, note the negative impacts etc…
<b>If we can't prove the existence of a syndrome, we cannot reasonably assume that any particular trait is an effect of that syndrome.</b>
No, we cannot.
However, if we can note a series of abnormal behaviors in an individual, we can prove the existence of a syndrome.","<b> If the variation of personality negatively impacts the person in his/her everyday life, then the variation of personality may be upgraded to a syndrome.</b>
The problem with this notion is that nobody's personality is such as entirely benefits them. I, for example, have an unmercifully short temper. Thus your definition would, again, label everybody a sufferer of some syndrome or other.
<b>The second part is about the control over the said variation. The person with the variation of personality is not able to control his variation of personality to successfully cope with every day life.</b>
Case example: homosexuality. Not a syndrome, uncontrollable, and in many cases has been detrimental to the person in question's wellbeing.
<b>As side question to you: what sort of proof would you expect to demonstrate the existence of intangible things such “a thought”, “jealousy”, ”learning process”?</b>
The existence of intangible things cannot, by definition, be incontrovertibly proven.

I find it very odd that learning always comes into this. perhaps it is the result of the recent societal emphasis on education, but I don't think that is an appropriate measure of whether one is suffering from a syndrome or not. Some people simply do not fit into academic environments, and to say that every human should is rather strange, as widespread attendance is a relatively recent phenomenon. 
Persons who are identified as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are usually old enough to speak. If they can learn a language through osmosis, they clearly have the ability to <i>actually</i> learn, so the variable is probably environment. 
As an analogy, consider people who are remarkably bright, but cannot abide the tedium of physical labour. As far as I am aware, there is no proposed syndrome to explain an inability to perform repetitive, physically difficult tasks with enthusiasm and full attention, so why is there one explaining an inability to do so with academic tasks? 
<b>Homosexuality is not harmful to the person’s wellbeing. Society is making it difficult for homosexuals to live peacefully.</b>
In both cases, the harm is external, the result of behaviour and attitude.
<b>What definition of intangible are you referring to?</b>
Things with no physical manifestation, either in matter or energy; something with no observable effects.
<b>The fact that the universe exists cannot be used for a proof of God but on the other hand the gathering of a certain number of scientific experiments, measurements, observations, will bring a reasonable amount of proof that the Universe does exist</b>
I think you missed the point, sir. Essentially, a trait cannot be used as evidence of a syndrome. The analogy simply meant that an effect does not directly prove any particular explanation of the cause. 
<b>There is a point when the behavior is not normal; it then qualifies as a disorder.</b>
That is a dubious definition. We must remember that we are labelling a particular behavioural set as a medical illness, which is an inference supported by absolutely no medical science whatsoever. Nobody has yet measured any chemical imbalance of the brain which would result in this behaviour, and yet it is purported to be a neurobiological condition.
Between six and seven million children in the United States alone receive methylphenidate or some other amphetamine every day, often <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uiL4wmDbo0&feature;=related'>with terrible side effects</a>. 
<b>What about the people whose paranoid moments are extreme to a point that it controls their lives?</b>
Then they clearly have a problem, but it is a psychological one, <a href='http://www.depression-guide.com/paranoia.htm'>usually the result of trauma</a>. A medical illness can be treated with a course of a particular medicine, after which the condition (except when the condition is genetic, for obvious reasons), but these disorders are usually treated with sedatives or insulin, which alters the sugar concentration of one's blood, thus naturally combating agitation.
The practical difference psychological disorders and medical illnesses is that the former cannot be cured through medical means, like polio or influenza <i>et cetera</i>. For some reason, however, and I suspect it may have something to do with money, we continue to treat <i>behaviour</i> with drugs.",4.0

<b>No, sir, it was merely intended to dismiss a semantic argument which had not place in this dispute.</b>
Calling what you even admit to be multiple sources, a single source ala: <b>Obviously, a minute inspection reveals that there are in one source of light, immense numbers of individual sources</b> an out of place matter of semantics is just sidestepping the issue because you don't find it convenient.
<b>What evidence do you present, which suggests that the two are unequal?</b>
I, like you, am only arguing based on my interpretation of the evidence I've had access to.
You supposed equality under conditions that exist only theoretically. You did not bring to bear measurements made under laboratory conditions, because readings from laboratory instrumentation are sensitive enough to quantify variance. Even barring interference from the medium, there is still the issue of non-steady state of the source. Keep sidestepping it and I will keep putting it in your face.
<b>All of the evidence which does exist (most saliently, the predictability of ionic bonding, the neutrality of atoms, the decay of radioactive isotopes et alia), proves that the proton and electron have charges of equal magnitude.</b>
To the contrary, the evidence shows that decay due to imbalance (inequality) is everywhere.
<b>And I suppose no such thing.</b>
You certainly don't see it that way but anyone can tell by what's emboldened below that essentially you are.
<b>I do not suspect, that there are any differences hidden behind the symbol of equality. Such an opinion would be contrary to the one which I have expressed.</b>","<b>Have you considered that there could be no generation of energy going on in such situations, only transfer of energy.</b>
I shall, in the interest of brevity, abandon the Socratic method. Whether through misdirection, or insensibility, it appears that I have failed to communicate the point of the inquiry.
 I shall assume as first principles that you are composed of matter, and that you are subject to the ordinary laws which govern the interaction of matter. Now, suppose that you were sitting on a chair (as you are likely doing), preferably one which is capable of supporting your weight without disintegration. Now, I say that, instantaneously, the force of gravitation, acting upon your body, and the normal force generated (no energy is generated, was purported to have been generated, or could possibly be generated) would be equal; or that, if there be a vibration in the bodies, that the average of the two forces would be equal.
I further posit that, due to circumstances implicitly demonstrated in the scenarios above, that the total quantity of matter-energy in any closed system, or in any open system when inputs and outputs are accounted accounted for, shall remain the same.
<b>So then show your class by attempting to ridicule what you don't understand why don't you</b>

I would not count James Boswell amongst the intelligentsia.

An instant is not a quantity of time, or of anything at all. It therefore cannot be dealt with in estimations. This is the premise upon which I have ridiculed your efforts against me.

I'll concede the latter charge. The first, I suspect, was included to augment the prose, the second made to insult the opponent. I am therefore not inclined to treat them as serious accusations.

I am simply extending to you the courtesy, of assuming that you understand what a Platonic Ideal is, and why they are relevant. I could end the empirical debate quite easily, I suspect, by proposing, that the fluctuations of time notwithstanding, the sum of all quantities in the universe remains the same. To remain the same, should be impossible, if the Platonic Ideal of equality were fictional.
No single observation or measurement can verify this, of course. However, the whole sum of observations and measurements that have ever been taken, anywhere, under scientific conditions supports the notion. You could, if you were so inclined, suggest that such a finite number of observations is insufficient, but then such would constitute an attack on empiricism itself, which would not avail you. 
<b>I find it funny that you act like an authority on what's scientific and whats pseudo-scientific, and don't seem to be able to tell the difference between informal argumentation and hypothesis! </b>
I am glad that you have profited in some way from this exchange.
<b>You side-step the fact that there is no steady source</b>
I had supposed that fact (for here we agree) to be irrelevant. The very fact that there are intelligible laws which govern waveforms, suggests that there is a Platonic Ideal of equality, and that identical wavelengths are possible.
<b>and never mind the fact that the all the prerequisite conditions of these supposedly perfectly identical waveforms exist only theoretically, that no measurements have been ever made by anyone under such conditions, you nevertheless won't let that stop you from talking like they have.</b>
I don't believe that I suggested that they had been. Obviously, you are attempting to defeat my arguments (and you are at liberty to question whether they constitute arguments) by asking for empirically obtained data which cannot be provided. I find this itself to be disingenuous, for you have yourself agreed that no instrumentation is precise enough to determine equality.
The greater deficiency of your line of inquiry, however, is that it is entirely inefficacious. Obviously, I am arguing on a Platonic plane. The quotation from Euclid, a section of which forms the title of this debate, also dealt with the Platonic plane; I had supposed this to be obvious. The reason for which I am sullying my hands, by the presentation of scenarios which exist within the imperfect world, and to which we must ascribe a degree of uncertainty, owing to the imperfection of our instruments and faculties, is because you give all the indications of being entirely ignorant of what a Platonic Ideal is. You may, indeed, have read of them, or have studied them, but you appear to have been unable to recognise them, when they were the topic of debate. 
I write, content in the suspicion that you will likely declare the above to be pseudo-intellectual (though, if Plato and Euclid were pseudo-intellectuals...) or an attempt to change the topic. For this reason, I shall iterate, in unequivocal language, what are my opinions upon the matter of equality. As a footnote, you may take magnitude for quantity, in most cases.
<i>Of the Platonic Equality</i>
I. Forms exist, as do properties and quantities.
II. The same properties may be measured, and expressed in equal units of quantity.
III. To measure, therefore, requires a concept of equality.
IV To measure a quantity or its effects, is the only empirical means of assessing quantity. 
V. Therefore empirical measurement, by III and IV, admits discourse of Platonic equality.
<i>Of empirical equality</i>
I. Instrumentation, though marvellously advanced, remains imperfect.
II. Therefore measurements made by instrumentation shall be imperfect.
III. Equality of quantity can only be ascertained with certainty by perfect measurement.
IV. By II and III, equality cannot be empirically, viz, by measurement, proved to exist.
Corollary I. Equality cannot, by the same principle, be empirically proven not to exist. 
<i>Of geometry</i>
I. Mathematical tautologies are always true.
II. Geometry is a branch of mathematics.
III. Geometry represents the relationships between real objects and quantities.
IV. Geometry may be and has been used to demonstrate equality in such relationships. <i>See Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Book I, section II, for a choice example</i>.
III. Equality exists in reality.
<i>Of divisibility of quantity</i>
I. Quantities may be measured.
II. Quantities so measured are implicitly divided.
III. The units into which a measured quantity is divided, are equal to one another.
IV. By II and III, every empirical measurement supposes equality to exist, to ensure its own efficacy.
<i>Grand conclusion</i>
Equality exists, and empiricism cannot, without destroying itself, disprove its existence.",4.0
88,./to_process\debate.show.All_thing_which_are_equal_lj.xml,All thing which are equal,"<b>Can you explain the nature of our disagreement?</b>
As I see it, sir, the nature of our dispute is thus:
<i><b>A history</b></i>
Finding contention with Euclid's first common notion, which is the premise of debate, you argued that empirical data renders dubious the concept of equality. Perceiving this, I argued first that empirical imperfection cannot disprove a Platonic Ideal; for, it is the nature of the empirical world to be only an imperfect manifestation of the same.
I, not having properly adhered to a classical structure of argument, foolishly fought upon the Platonic field with weapons more suited to mundane combat. <i>Videlicet</i>, I couched Platonic argument in empirical terms, which confused the issue. This gave you occasion to call into question the authority with which I pronounced upon these matters.
Finding that my line of argument was provoking hostility, I reverted to First Principles, which if my notions be correct, ought to be unassailable. 
<i><b>A summary</b></i>
By the history above, the nature of our dispute has been obfuscated. In essence, therefore, I shall declare it: I maintain that equality is a real Platonic Ideal which is essential to empirical measurement, whereas you maintain that empirical measurement disproves the concept of equality.","<b>I maintain that equality is a real Platonic Ideal which is essential to empirical measurement, whereas you maintain that empirical measurement disproves the concept of equality.</b>
I do not dispute that equality is ""a real Platonic Ideal which is essential to empirical measurement"", however, that empirical measurement ""renders dubious the concept of equality"" remains my position. I do not hold the position that it disproves it.

Because there is no evidence whether they exist or not. But it is more reasonable to presume they do not. Every different turn of the smallest amount of energy would cause a different universe. You do know how many versions of our universes that would mean? Far too many to be real if you ask me.
<b>Why is it most probable that we will never have evidence?</b>
And how would you go about finding the evidence? For that you should, literally, be able to break through our universe, one way or another. Sounds like science fiction, as at this point it is. Something that might be possible but there is no evidence, no proof.
We are capable of coming up with scenarios that do not have any evidence and, again, most probably never will. In this case it would be wise and smart to recognize the false ones and and claim them unreal, until further notice... still.
<b>If we do have no evidence and if probability is against us of finding evidence, that doesn't mean alternate realities don't exist.</b>
Assuming that all of existence, not just our universe, is infinite. There is a possibility that somewhere out there could be every ""alternate"" version of everything that is over here. But that just sounds not true.
The universe began with a ""bang"". All the energies and particles and whatnot that came from there, their course could be tracked and projected, theoretically, till the ""end"". If there is no external influence to their path they will always go the same way. It could, theoretically, be possible to look into the future and change the course of events, but then that is still the path of particles, energies, etc. and would be part of the projection from the beginning. Only an influence that came from outside our universe could actually ""change"" the course. But that would not create another universe. The current one would be changed and that change would be permanent.

This reason is a very poor reason and i don't mean to insult you. To me, that is like jumping to the conclusion after giving up on research. You must think this is also silly. I do not find it reasonable at all. This logic is the same if i stated to my teachers in 9th grade that the acceleration of gravity do not exist because i had no evidence for it.

94,./to_process\debate.show.Am_I_Omnipotent_lj.xml,Am I Omnipotent,"<b>""You're putting limitations on god based on the rules of the reality we live in...""</b>
Basically, yes. I think you have to. I believe that, in order for something to exist, it must be subject to the nature of existence. Existence behaves a certain way, and anything that can be said to exist is subject to this behavior. Axioms such as the Law of Identity are ways we describe this behavior, and serve as a basis for logic. 
If something is not subject to these ""laws of existence,"" or ""laws of reality,"" then I don't think it can be said to exist, as it's not meeting the requirements of existence. Obviously, since theists want to show that God exists, they must allow for God to be subject the nature of what it is to exist. Thus, God cannot create or do things that are not consistent with the nature of existence.
This is why the simplest definition of omnipotence, ""X can do everything,"" isn't valid. It doesn't exclude things that are logically impossible. 
So, the definition changes to ""X can do everything that is logically possible to do."" This is still a problem though, because God is not just limited to the laws of existence. God is limited (mostly) to his moral nature as presented in the Bible. God cannot lie, God cannot commit an immoral act, etc. This means there are some things that are logically possible but not possible for a being with God's traditional properties.
So, the definition changes again. ""X can do everything that is logically possible for a being with X's defining properties."" This is the definition I was running with here, so the problem is obvious. Once you allow omnipotence to be relativised to a set of properties, it opens up the possibility for multiple omnipotent beings. You could have a being whose defining property is the inability to do anything, and it would be compatible with this definition of omnipotence.
The definition can evolve further, stating that ""X can do everything that is logically possible for a being with X's defining properties to do; and there is no being conceivable with greater powers than X."" But this definition runs into the same problem as the second. There are logically possible things God cannot do due to His being morally perfect. A being could be conceived that is like God, but isn't morally perfect. This being could do everything God could, as well as perform morally evil acts. This being would be more powerful than God.","<b>If something is not subject to these ""laws of existence,"" or ""laws of reality,"" then I don't think it can be said to exist, as it's not meeting the requirements of existence.</b>
Well yes. Christians and many theists are arguing for something that defies the laws of reality, and this is one of many things that leads me to believe that god doesn't exist. But this doesn't mean that he doesn't defy the laws of reality - even if you're assuming his existence for the sake of argument, that doesn't change the fact that he does the impossible. 
<b>It doesn't exclude things that are logically impossible.</b>
I don't think it has to, as the logically impossible is just a day at work for god. If he only did easy, logical, possible things, I don't think he would be worshiped as a god. 
<b>God cannot lie, God cannot commit an immoral act, etc.</b>
Woah, who said god can't be immoral? I know the Bible <i>tries</i> to paint a good picture of god for public consumption, but if you read it cover to cover I think you'll find god to be quite an immoral character. Immense power doesn't imply perfect morals - Christians just want god to work that way. Look at the Greek gods; immensely powerful, but just as flawed as humans, morally. 
<b>Once you allow omnipotence to be relativised to a set of properties</b>
I don't. You and Chuck have been trying to do this, but when I am confronted with the idea of an all-powerful being who is by definition unknowable, I don't see myself as being able to put limitations on that power because I don't know god. I know you don't know him either, because you're a human, just like me. So I go with the standard definition of omnipotence; that any being who is all powerful can do whatever the fuck they want.",4.0

If I (or anyone) find traits consistently in any group of people, then, yes, they'll develop some sort of automatic judgment.

If you were a white person, you would be outright attacked for being a racist, and I think you're being ridiculous. 
It's perfectly fair for the a British person to dislike French policy choices (and many do), and it's fair for them to dislike aspects of French culture- perhaps they think wine is an inappropriate beverage for those under eighteen, for instance. However, a blanket statement about all (or most, or even one) British disliking all the French is racist. Yes, you're ALLOWED to do anything you please- I could up and start hating Nigerian/Chinese Jews that support fascism, but that would be ungrounded and pointless. I can tell you that I disagree with fascism as a legitimate form of government, but that';s not to say that I would hate all Jews that support fascism of Nigerian and Chinese descent.

Not racist.. just ignorant. Most people haven't got a clue about the caste system and what it's about and how it came into development etc.
It's hard for white people to understand where I'm coming from because it's been grounded into your heads that to say you dislike anybody in any type of group is some kind of phobia or -ism.
It is perfectly legitimate for northern Americans to dislike southern americans due to that war (I've got the divide right, right?)
An example:
Tottenham and Arsenal (British football teams) dislike each other. They're rivals. Is it teamist for them to dislike each other?? Why is this ok? It's the CLUB that is rival to the other CLUB.

This is how we classify animals. We look for inheritable traits that separate them from each other.
<b>Second, I am very confused to find some nationalities to be a race... If someone can enlighten me with clear and logical explanations, that would be nice.</b>
This tends to happen when an ancestral race founds a community in a region with little immigration or contact with outsiders. The race then extends to the borders of the state, and in modern day this merely represents the homogeneous race of members of that nation.
<b>Third, why do I believe that Americans are multiracial?
America is a big “melting pot” of people from around the World. The probability of meeting people of different ethnicities is bigger than anywhere else....

<b>If you understand ""genetics"" as well as I do you should understand that is ""the idea of different races"" doesn't make sense because we could have had ancestor of various colors. All this leading to Americans are multiracial. </b>

Indeed, we classify animals: There are monkeys, cats, dogs, humans. There are also vertebrates, invertebrates. There are reptilians, arachnids… But we don’t classify short men vs tall men; we measure them in inches or feet or centimeters and give their height a number. We don’t classify specific physical traits like blond or brunette; those are inherited by the way. Maybe it would be more acceptable to measure the level of skin pigmentations and classify by range. At least it would be objectively measured.

Yes. Now you answer mine.
<b>Democracy is as much a tyranny as the worst autocracy</b>
Not true at all. Officials can fail to be re-elected. It happens all the time. They can be impeached.
<b>After he is elected, he can do as he pleases, so long as he corrupts the necessary people, which is always possible.</b>
Not if a government has appropriate checks on power. I suppose <i>technically</i> he still could, but then anyone could do anything assuming they ""corrupt the necessary people"", so this is not a useful statement.
<b>When was the last time a democratic government ceased an activity, repealed a law or abstained from some new tax because of public demands.</b>
It doesn't happen very often, but I would say that's because democratic governments generally don't pass unpopular laws.
<b>Rather let us have one Caesar, one champion of the people.</b>
What makes you think this Caesar would be a champion of the people?
<b>Modern democracy ultimately consists of idiots choosing between two or more groups of idiots.</b>
Not true. Intelligence is normally distributed. And I think the bell-curve of both the electorate and the elected must be skewed to the right.
<b>I do not bow before something so fickle as the tyranny of the masses.</b>
You do it every day. If you didn't you would be arrested.
<b>people do not know what they want</b>
They do when it comes to certain things. People generally want sustinence, safety, good relationships, etc. I think it's safe to say they know they want these things.
<b>They are so staggeringly stupid that you can tell them what they want and they will believe you.</b>
I don't think this is true. People can be influenced to various degrees -- but if it were so easy to shape opinion, democratic processes would be a lot less contentious.
<b>Being allowed to kill your daughter's rapist does not equate to a license to kill indiscriminately.</b>
Why should you be able to disregard the rule of law in one case but not another? Would such hypocrisy not undermine the law's authority?
<b>In this case you would simply lead the killers to your family, endangering them as well.</b>
Come on, now. I was trying to come up with a situation where there would be profound negative consequences to fighting and profound benefits to running away. I'm sure you can imagine such a circumstance.
<b>I was saying that I should rather conquer the world and subjugate everybody in it for the betterment of my own people and their allies than I would level the entire race to mediocrity.</b>
""Level to mediocrity""? When did I suggest that? I said greatness comes from improving humanity. This benefit need not be distributed uniformly.

The king or queen shall have military power, the dictator shall have legislative power, but will usually answer to the senate.

The element of a king and queen introduces an element of immediate social inequality, and a sacrifice of merit, because a bloodline does not guarantee fitness for the task.
The big way that your system can fail is through the royalty working together with the dictator to grant him perpetual autocratic rights. The monarchs may wish for complete power and would use the dictator as a proxy for their authority, especially if favours are provided to the dictator. Another way this could fail is by dictators slowly lengthening the period of their absolute power, until it is for years or even a lifetime.
Your system creates competition between two parties for complete control, with cooperation being a way in which they can achieve it, or infighting to cancel the other out.
<b>I believe I have addressed this with my system.</b>
If you distribute power amongst many, then it becomes very difficult to amass influence. The risk only comes in cooperation amongst groups of those who share power, to form a kind of gang based on shared values.

<b>After he is elected, he can do as he pleases, so long as he corrupts the necessary people, which is always possible.</b>
Not if a government has appropriate checks on power. I suppose <i>technically</i> he still could, but then anyone could do anything assuming they ""corrupt the necessary people"", so this is not a useful statement.

<b>People want, and will vote for, policies which they think will benefit them, policies which forward their idealogical views, etc.</b>
See, they don't understand half of these policies, as political parties masquerade their agendas as legitimate plans of action. When they do something right, it is to secure their own dominance, whereafter they may for some years do as they please. The constant to and fro has left most people either confused or fanatic. The confused do not understand by default, whereas the fanatics know only what they have been told to know, figuratively speaking. More literally, they have been told by those they favour that such is the case, therefore such must be done. They rarely understand the ramifications of either their political inertia or the policies they blindly support.
<b>I don't think you're really saying anything here, other than declaring people other than yourself stupid.</b>

One way would be if a group or some of the ""smart people"" could find a way to power and then find and increase the support for them (a support based on truth not lies). I think that finding the support should be made rather secretly, outside their rivals' sight. Once they have that it should be rather easy to change things.
It is not unrealistic. People just don't go for it, they have grown up in a seemingly ""safe"" and comfortable world and are afraid of change. Thinking it will mess up everything when in fact it would improve everything.

First off, thank-you for taking the challenge on presenting your case; and that is to any others who do so as well.
I am not sure how civilized extorting money or property from people is civilized.
<b>Living in a society grants benefits that are worth paying for.</b>
There might be many benefits to living among a certain amount of fellow human-beings, sure, but if I am forcibly robbed on a regular basis, it kind of cheapens any sort of value I initially placed on living with them. This is not saying that myself and a certain amount of people get together and agree to pool our money to pay for certain things; this is by consent.
<b>Taxes serve to guaranty each member contributes to their society,</b>
An Individual can contribute or not and it would be wise to others in a given society to not chase people away because then, their society dissolves; without Individual human-beings voluntarily, of their own free-will consenting to organize into a society, it cannot exist. 'Society' is a non-entity, as is 'government'; neither of which have any sort of ability to act. 
<b>they are benefiting from the taxes of those before them and it would be stealing not to contribute in the form their society has decided.</b>

If I get a group of five men together and tell you that you must give us money to contribute to your protection from us hurting you, this is okay or right to do? Correct me if I am wrong, but I am guessing your answer would be no, no one has the right to do such a thing; even if I called it something nice it does not change what it is.

<i>If god loves you enough, everything will work out to your benefit, if he doesn't, you will end up being tormented eternally. If you are one of the poor souls that god created to be a ""vessel of wrath"" you might as well relish in your evil ways as much as you can, because there is no way god is going to change his mind about where you are to end up. Despite bible verses to the contrary, god doesn't change his mind. Those who make the cut with god, are saved from eternal torture through a ""special"" form divine justice that allows for someone innocent to be punished in lieu of the guilty party. Now that might seem obviously unjust, and patently ridiculous, but it doesn't stop there. If you happen to be one of the elect, not only do you get to have an innocent person punished on your behalf, but this person is actually the judge who is miraculously his own son.

Back when there was a lot more anarchy, and chaos and etc. and people did not have any answers for anything, religion gave a pretty good guess as long as it sounded convincing.

To me, this highlights your naive view of how force works. The settlers rolled in with guns, took their land, enslaved them and killed any that didn't join them.

If we found a horn and we ruled out all other species 100% then all that would mean is it belonged to a species we haven't discovered yet, hypothesizing it belongs to a unicorn is assuming to many details about what kind animal it belonged to. The horn could belong to a unicorn, but I could create an entire beatiary of mythical animals I completely made up and argue for each animal individually for being the creature the horn belonged to. This is illogical, it's better to document the horn, preserve it, and let researchers and scientists try to find out where the horn truly came from by finding the animal first, if there is a good reason to suspect certain details of an animal, that is one thing, (like poison being on the tip the horn, then we could assume that the animal could have had poison reserves somewhere in the body to use to inject into other creatures with its horn).

Are you familiar with the concept of Quantum Foam? On a planck level, particles routinely create themselves and then destroy themselves on a scale of time and space so small that they could have barely been said to exist at all. At this level physics no longer applies as it did before.
There is still so much about the laws of nature that we don't know. We have barely scratched the surface. By comparison, your concept of God looks very primitive and/or archaic. God was simply the way ancient people made sense of their world. The more we know, the more we understand that what ancient peoples called God, we call Nature. The difference is that you give human attributes to it and worship it.
<b>I disagree, to believe the physical nature has no cause is pure absurdity.</b>
Quantum Mechanics is pure absurdity, but we know it to be true.
<b>If you believe there is no original cause then you would have to believe you don't exist or that anything does.</b>
""If you believe that God has no cause, then you would have to believe that God doesn't exist.""
-See how that little trick works?
No, for me to believe that the universe has no singular original cause, would mean I would have to believe that time is not linear. Which it isn't.
<b>Mine and all other Christians beliefs.</b>
Well, that's nice but it certainly doesn't make it a fact.
<b>Miracles demonstrate His power that He can operate beyond those physical laws.</b>
Which is why I said it makes no sense for your God to make the natural laws to only defy them later. For an all-knowing God, it shows a lack of forethought.
Why not make the laws to work for him instead of against him? Why intervene at all, if everything is going according to plan? 
<b>The distant starlight isn't proof of long ages.</b>
If this isn't proof, then I don't know what would be. What in your mind would prove the old age of the universe?
<b>There are many different theories that account for such distance.</b>
And every single one of them is a rationalization, the sole purpose of which is to fill the logical holes in your theology. Despite the fact that none of them have any scientific evidence, or biblical support for that matter. To suggest that God performed some miracle so that we could see light from distant stars is an insult to my intelligence. 
There are plenty of stars that are close enough to be seen without any divine intervention, there would be no reason to perform such a miracle in the first place. Such a rationalization exists only to reconcile the difference between reality and their worldview.
<b>You willfully deny your Creator so you can live without guilt.</b>
Bullocks! Everybody experiences guilt, atheists and Christians alike. We just feel guilty about slightly different things.
Even if I did deny your God to avoid guilt, that wouldn't necessarily make everything I said incorrect. You're violating the circumstantial ad hominem fallacy.

Furthermore, your disputed argument fails to address the impact on society of the idea that the cultural ideal of beauty is to be valued above other attributes. It's a damaging idea because there are far more important attributes to be honored in people than beauty.

<b>It's a damaging idea because there are far more important attributes to be honored in people than beauty.</b> 
Just because you single out an attribute and judge it does not mean it is the most important attribute.

Well, what have athletes, singers, actors, comedians, etc. ever done in terms of contribution to society? Just because they give no practical use does not make them bad.

Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the National Human Genome Research Institute since 1993 (whom I would think it would be hard pressed to call him ""uneducated""), states in the article linked below,

You see, this is one of those huge misunderstandings about statistics, and how properly to use them in an argument. Our existance is BECAUSE of the conditions for it being available, not the other way around. This type of argument starts from the wrong perspective. ""Isn't it amazing that the universe had exactly the right conditions for us to be here?"" Nope. We're here because we are what evolved BECAUSE of the conditions. If the conditions were similar, something else would be in our place thinking ""Wow, I can't believe the universe has the exact conditions for us to be here!"" I'm suprised this isn't perfectly clear to such a brilliant man.
I believe science and God are completely mutually exclusive. When the conception of Gods came around, it was to explain the (then) unexplainable. The original Gods were characters who would control the sun, make the crops grow, makes the tides rise and fall. If we all took a second out to think about where the idea of God started from, we would be well aware that ""that"" version of God has been moulded into something undisprovable. Science pushed the physical God into a metaphysical wishy washy nonsense.

156,./to_process\debate.show.Are_big_corporations_good_or_bad_lj.xml,Are big corporations good or bad?,"Big corporations are machines of economic centralization and economic stratification. They tend to suck up huge amounts of wealth and capital and deliver it to a rather small number of people. 
This sort of concentration of wealth has several consequences:
1. First and foremost, large corporations have the ability to dominate local markets. Shoving out smaller businesses and keeping new ones from developing. 
2. Wealth becomes stratified and concentrated in the greater population. This has ramifications for the economy as a whole; it can produce recessions due to a large number of people who have little to no real wage growth and an increasing amount of capital that cannot be spent on investments due to the fact that demand is not increasing. Economic stagnation tends to occur because of this process.
Another problem comes with innovation; big corporations are essentially economic bureaucracies. A small number of people make the decisions and approve the ideas while the vast majority of people have little to no say in how things are run and what products and services are produced (and how). 
3. Money is power, the large the corporation and the more our economy is dominated by large corporations the more political power corporations have. Because of the wealth concentration effects of corporations we see a complete shift of power away from lower and middle-class people and towards the rich who own the corporations as well as the corporations themselves. (The CEO of Mcdonalds and the Mcdonalds corporation can, independently, give to a particular political party or candidate). 
If you believe in democracy you should be fairly worried about this trend. 
Also, the domination of a few media conglomerates; the control of all of our major sources of information and communication, is also worrisome in a democracy. It guarantees that certain viewpoints will never be expressed (or be expressed sparingly) and others will be pushed extensively. 
Fox News is not the only guilty party, all of the major media outlets censor the information being given to us.","<b>1. First and foremost, large corporations have the ability to dominate local markets. Shoving out smaller businesses and keeping new ones from developing.</b>
Smaller businesses can continue to exist if they are savvy. They could, and have, cornered niche markets that stores like Wal-mart can't, such as. local market food, or any unique product. The only time they go out of business is when they are selling a like product and can't keep their prices low enough, thereby directing the consumer to big box stores where the same thing costs less. In that sense it is the people, not the big businesses, that drive out smaller businesses. Also, most of these stores like walmart are retailers, and their products come from a large variety of other companies, creating internal competition.
Also, I actually haven't seen this phenomenon happen on the scale normally described. In my home town we have a walmart as well as a plethora of small businesses including bookstores, restaurant, clothing stores, music and electronic stores, repair shops and variety stores. Though these places are have generally higher prices, they also have a selection that is very different from the select brands Walmart offers. 
In the city (Halifax) the story is even better. There are more than 3 big box stores meaning they are in competition, and downtown where huge retailers can't fit small business is flourishing. I think the argument that they ""shove out smaller businesses"" comes from a type of unfounded cynicism. The people controlling the market are the consumers. Ultimately you are the ones, collectively, who put out of business the uncompetitive. 
<b>2. Wealth becomes stratified and concentrated in the greater population.</b>
That is an awfully dubious claim. Could you cite some empirical data? In general, big corporations raise the living standards of everyone because of the low prices they are able to afford, and profit they make goes right to the stock holders who often depend on big business for their retirement etc. or back into investment. Look at Exxon Mobil. Sure they're making huge profits in terms of ""that number is big."" But relative to what they spend, they only get 9.8 cents for every dollar of revenue. That is low. The rest goes back into innovation, exploration, mutual funds, and other things that do precisely the opposite of concentrate wealth. Truth be told, only a handful of executives and presidents get the million dollar salaries -- still less than Judge Judy might I add. To give you a comparison, Google's profit margin is 29.89%, Walmart 3.5%, Shell Oil 7.9% (average profit margin for the last 20 years has been 8.3%). Only one solution. Tax Google's record profits! Or how bout no, because Google and everyone else benefits from putting that revenue back into the system.
<b>Another problem comes with innovation; big corporations are essentially economic bureaucracies. A small number of people make the decisions and approve the ideas while the vast majority of people have little to no say in how things are run and what products and services are produced (and how).</b>
I'd appreciate some examples for what your saying. Stock holders have a say. Consumers have a say. And they make their say by not buying the product. Here, if you don't like Coke and Pepsi for reason X, then buy the locally brewed soda. Propeller Soda Pop is a locally run business and, in my opinion, they taste better too. Also, it is true that the there is a lot of economic bureaucracy in big business. But what's the alternative? Oh yah, coercive bureaucracy ie. government.
<b>3. Money is power, the large the corporation and the more our economy is dominated by large corporations the more political power corporations have.</b>

There is a solution to this though. It's called smaller government!

Advertising is a part of any successful enterprise, and I do not believe that if company X sells product A for a cheaper price than company Y, that company X will not have enough money from people flocking to that place for the lower prices to advertise on a larger scale! That's how all companies start out, and that's ultimately how retailers become successful. Minimal advertising attracts a basis for future advertisement. In fact, the only benefit Wal-mart has in advertisement is that it's on a national scale. That kind of advertisement would be useless to a local business that only really requires fliers and a newspaper spot.
<i>Big businesses have other advantages that small businesses (in their industry) cannot compete with.</i>
The only tangible advantage big business has is the sense that they're successful and have a reason that success. That's like saying ""successful businesses have an advantage over unsuccessful businesses, insofar as they're more successful."" That suffers from conspicuously poor logic. As I said, ultimately the consumer decides, and they in the mass, always decide toward the company that gives the best quality and quantity for the least cost (which is usually the larger businesses). This is the nature of competition, and very basic economic theory. 
<i>When certain markets or regions take an economic downturn; say the state of Missouri sees a major economic slump and consumer demand plunges. Wal-Mart and other major stores can continue to operate off of the profits from other areas of the country. Small businesses, however, don't have the luxury of a vast supply of income from a variety of regions and sources.</i>
How is that a bad thing? Companies like Sears and Wal-mart etc. have been the last hope for many regions hit with disaster. They're more resilient, and that is a very good thing for people who need food, clothing, and shelter immediately after a natural disaster or economic downturn. Once people are back on their feet they can, with the same ease, reopen their enterprise without any resistance. 
<i>Also, big corporations can go into a developing area; drop their prices way below the competition (taking a loss) and use the profits from other areas of the country (or world) to wait for the other businesses to go under, close, and then put their prices back up to normal.</i>
It would have to be a very developing area, because the places with the most people unusually have many big retailers like Chapters, Futureshop, Target, Macy's, Barnes & Noble, Old Navy, Winners, and down the list that are all in a sort of competition for the best retailer. In smaller developing areas, where there are admittedly less people effected, what you describe is possible. Again, though, as in my hometown where we basically only have a Wal-mart when it comes to big name suppliers, businesses can always (and always do) reopen once the prices are low. This is a necessary fact for the simple reason that towns need employment -- more than Wal-mart can satisfy. Nevertheless, the stores that Wal-mart ends up shutting down are stores that sell like-goods for higher costs. Niche markets remain open unabated. Again, however unfortunate you wish make this out to be, it was completely determined by consumers democratically moving their business to Wal-mart. 
<i>People will buy discount poison drops if they said ""quality pain killer"" on it.</i>
Hopefully not without suing the making for fraud.
<i>Just because people are making bad choices doesn't mean it legitimizes the choice.</i>
Why are they bad choices? Over all, the existence of a Wal-mart or like business in small communities is indicative of local wealth. In other words, it's a sign of economic health. Just because a few business owners get hurt along the way doesn't make it a bad choice, nor does it negate the fact that it is completely determined my the consumer. All you are doing is describing facts of competition -- a positive trait of capitalism. 
<i> Just because people are willing to buy cheap goods made from children in sweatshops doesn't mean that choice is legitimate and shouldn't be taken away.</i>
Why not? Because of capital flow and economic globalization have caused poverty rates to drop dramatically in places like China, compared to areas less affected by globalization, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, where poverty rates have remained stagnant. I understand the desire for good working conditions in these developing countries, but the simple fact is that if it weren't for the ""sweat shops"" they would be completely jobless. Capitalism with reduced trade barriers stands alone in it's ability to raise people out of poverty, sweat shops being a starting point (in the last 20 years the number of people in developing countries living under $1 a day has dropped from 40% to 20%).
""The percentage of people living on less than $2 a day has decreased greatly in areas effected by globalization, whereas poverty rates in other areas have remained largely stagnant. In East-Asia, including China, the percentage has decreased by 50.1% compared to a 2.2% increase in Sub-Saharan Africa."" So you see what you are characterizing as the problem is in actuality the beginnings of the solution.
<i>People don't have the economic right to preference slavery over freemen factory goods. Are you saying we should legalize slavery and let the market decide?</i>

Libertarianism is not a state of anomie. It is not lawless. That state and local governments still define laws within the context of human relation with individual rights being cardinal. The starting rights are your right to life, followed by liberty and the pursuit of happiness, each depending on the preceding right to exist.

<i>How can this be? How can wages be going down by .3 per cent (that's not even factoring in our ever rising inflation) while our productivity, as individuals, has increased 8.4 per cent? Why isn't the market giving back?</i>
I don't quite understand what you're asking, nor does that link you gave me give nearly enough details. However, here are some (i think) relevant things to bare in mind. 'These statistics do not tell the whole story. Taken alone, they portray workers’ living standards in the most negative light possible by ignoring almost a third of what workers earn. Benefits are an increasingly large component of worker compensation and now account for 30 percent of workers’ pay—and this proportion has risen sharply in recent years. Ignoring benefits misses much of what workers actually earn, but that is what the eco­nomic pessimists do.'
'Another of the pessimists’ claims is that workers are being shortchanged because wages have not kept pace with productivity growth.[21] Since 1995, worker productivity has increased rapidly. Employ­ees now produce far more per hour than at any time in the past. According to economic theory, competition should force companies to pass on productivity gains to their workers as higher wages and compensation.'
'However, the current lag in wage growth is not unprecedented; in fact, it is familiar. Wages and productivity often diverge during the course of the business cycle. For example, pro­ductivity grew faster than compensa­tion for several years after the recovery from the 1991 recession. The last reces­sion ended in November 2001, five years ago. At this same point following the end of the 1991 recession, productivity had risen 8.4 percent, while compensation had risen only 5.2 percent.'
'Earnings growth did not match productivity growth in the 1990s until 1997, when the unem­ployment rate fell and companies faced competi­tion to hire increasingly productive workers. As a result, incomes shot up. By 1999, employee com­pensation had fully caught up to the productivity gains of the early 1990s. In the end, income and productivity did move together, but that result took several years to reach.'

I read the beginning of that Forbes article and question whether you actually read it all. The article prefaces the theory that bureaucracy stifles innovation, and then the author of the article goes on to show categorically why this is false. It's almost like what creationists do when they quote Darwin talking about the improbability of the eye evolving... right before he goes on to explain how the eye evolved. Talk about tunnel-vision! In fact, the header on the second page of the article reads ""HOW BUREAUCRACY AIDS INNOVATION"".
<i>Not exactly anti-business organizations, yet they both talk about how large corporations tend to stagnate when it comes to innovation.</i>
Do you have any credibility left? You should that you have no desire to read past the first paragraph, when the last paragraph in the preamble states: ""In the following passages, I will take you through several examples of how bureaucracy and tight controls are facilitating, contributing to, and supporting the innovation efforts in some large, diversified, and well-known corporations.""
Innovation may very well work with bureaucracy, but incentives to innovate are a market force. That's why America has the best health care technology in the world, and why countries with socialized medicine ride on America's back for new advances.
Your other link from portfolio doesn't seem to contradict this either. The author is in fact praising companies like Apple and Wal-Mart. He goes on to explain how companies take over a market they plateau. They have no real reason to innovate, just like a species adapted to its environment has no need to evolve. ""The reward is that they get big. The punishment is that when they get big, it gets harder and harder for them to grow,"" says Grove, which is in essence exactly what I said earlier. It is undesirable for a company to have an absolute monopoly. 
The main purpose of that article is to discuss the theory of ""cross boundary disruption,"" where a corporation diverges from it's normal industry ""with an innovative product or service [to] shake up the status quo and reap big profits."" He cites many examples of this. This is a positive aspect of capitalism and is the opposite of ""yet they both talk about how large corporations tend to stagnate when it comes to innovation.""
<a href='http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/casse/2103'>Commentarymagazine</a> reports, ""The amount Grove is spending is a fraction of what the Gates Foundation has, but you do get the sense that his “creative capitalism” is far more rigorous than what Gates has in mind. For Grove, the problem isn’t the nature of capitalism, it is the lack of contrarian second-guessing within business and governments that is the real enemy of innovation.""
I'm happy to see the things you are citing against capitalism are in fact for capitalism.
<i>First of all, a small government would give even greater power to corporations; without a strong government most decisions would be left up, directly, to those with the most economic power; not indirectly through bribes, lobbying, and campaign funding.</i>
I think I already covered, and indeed economic theorist settled this decades ago, that a companies interest is the consumers interest so long as market forces exist. Big government takes away these market forces, making a company immune, and thus removing the incentive to lower prices and increase quality for market share.
<i>Tell me, how on earth is a politician supposed to get elected without campaign contributions? How on earth are they supposed to get elected without the assistance of mass media? Without support from big business and the media another candidate would simply get in who is.</i>
I agree. The political system is very corruptible in terms of the shady exchange between special interests and politicians. That wouldn't be an issue though, if politicians didn't have such power. It's only under a Keynesian frame of mind that government has exploded in size, especially so under the Bush administration. A limited government would have, of course, limited powers. In my dream world no one person in America would have the power to bomb Iran, or invade a country, or to wire tap, or execute, and so on, thus making it nearly impossible for a single corrupt soul from ruining the country. Of course it is still possible, but much more difficult. 
<i>In other words, there are plenty of honest politicians or people who want to be honest politicians. The problem is that the system rewards the dishonest.</i>
Completely agree. Ironically, this is an argument against decreasing government size and powers, and increasing government transparency. 
<i>We cannot have a Democracy with a small government, we would end up in a true Plutocracy; a society government exclusively by the rich.</i>
You mean like Russia, or China, or North Korea, or Cuba, or Venezuela, or Briton, or Norway, or, pardon me, the United States of America? Do you honestly think the Obamas, Kennedys, Bushes, Clintons etc. are poor? 
No, in a limited government the ruling class is the average citizen. I also, like most libertarians, advocate power being allocated to the 50 states and the states being sovereign. They should be able to create their regulations and bylaws without overruling by federal law (except the constitution) or supreme court ruling, and the ""executive branch"" should probably be removed all together.
This would open up a multiparty system because ideologies are typically geographical (bible belt, North East liberals, etc.). The only reason we have a 2 party system in America now is because the Democratic platform and the Republican platform are vague enough to make all other potential parties (communist, green, libertarian, marijuana) conform. This would make the representative government truly representative. Of course, this is going off topic from capitalism, and I do not speak for all capitalists.
<i>I also wonder why you only see fit to blame politicians and never corporations. Are corporations small children who are just swept up in political corruption by accident? They know exactly what they are doing, they are doing it for their bottom line, and to blame politicians only is to, again, be intellectual dishonest.</i>
I beg to differ. Corporations always want to appeal to three things. The stock holders, their employees, and their customers. This is the break down of the profit motive. So they pursue not technically ""their self interest"". The corporation isn't a person. It is made up of those three parts. So who is to blame? The corporation for pursuing the bottom line for it's components (which runs the economy), or crooked politicians for enabling them to now follow the rules. When discussing cause and effect, it is the new condition that is usually attributed to the cause, be it the finger that pulls the trigger, or the congressmen that opens the door for the special interest?
<i>No matter what political system, big government, small government, monarchy, theocracy, dictatorship...the people who hold economic power hold political power. It's beguiling that you don't seem to recognize this.</i>
What political power, under the system I have described, does the ""big corporation"" have? They don't hold power. They do under the current system. In my system it is the individual who has the power. The citizen. 
<i>People cannot make good, logical decisions when their information is controlled by either political or economic entities with a vested interest in their deception.</i>
Deception is fraud, and there is room under my system for class action law suits. Simply saying ""they will lie for profit"" is not enough. You have to prove that it is feasible that they will lie when the law prohibits it.","<i>It never matters whether or not a given product or service is superior; a small business could be outdoing Wal-Mart in price (and, in my experience, Wal-Mart's prices aren't lower, at least for what I used to buy there), it doesn't matter though, as Wal-Mart is ""known"" for low prices, just like Uncle Bill's Snake Oil is ""known"" for curing baldness, scurvy, and depression.</i>

What you seem to underestimate in your argument is the power of a brand. Branding has been at work on such a large scale, that nearly all choices are affected by it. As a child, McDonald's makes you a lifelong customer through advertisements and Happy Meals (associating a clown and toys with their food). 
If you want proof that superior products do not win out over branding, just look at beer. 1,500 breweries operate in the US, but yet in 2003, the top 3 brands (Anheuser-Busch, Miller, and Coors) accounted for 82% of the market (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_in_the_United_States#Beer_and_society).  Not only are these brands crap (the light versions, that is, which are so heavily and successfully marketed), they are identical crap. On Penn and Teller's BullSh!t, those who claimed one of the 3 (Bud Lt, Miller Lt, and Coors Lt.) as their ""favorite beer"" could not identify it in a blind taste test. 
<b>The only tangible advantage big business has is the sense that they're successful and have a reason that success. That's like saying ""successful businesses have an advantage over unsuccessful businesses, insofar as they're more successful."" </b> 
No, the tangible advantage is that from their success they have ridiculous power, both in terms of financial stability and brand management. 
<b>Corporations always want to appeal to three things. The stock holders, their employees, and their customers. This is the break down of the profit motive.</b>
As such, they are willing to break the law so long as there is more financial incentive to break the law and pay a penalty for bad behavior than to not do so and lose out on potential profit. They care not for their effects on consumers, society, or the environment. They will try to make as much money as we possibly will let them. 
IMO we've let them go way too far. Oil companies, pharmaceuticals, and all the rest are taking advantage of the consumer and of America. It's tragic that we've gotten to this point, but I don't believe you're right that legislation will stop them. They ignore current legislation because they make more money by ignoring it than by following the law. Until they're held accountable for their effects on the population, they will continue to reap power from the people.",4.0
158,./to_process\debate.show.Are_big_corporations_good_or_bad_lj.xml,Are big corporations good or bad?,"1. You have rather strange ideas about advertising, ideas which aren't even held by those practicing your Capitalistic ideals. Wal-Mart and other national and international chains would probably disagree with you when you state the following:
""In fact, the only benefit Wal-mart has in advertisement is that it's on a national scale. That kind of advertisement would be useless to a local business that only really requires fliers and a newspaper spot.""
This is curious; seeing as you seem to miss the fundamentals behind the business. You see, national advertising doesn't matter to local businesses when the advertiser is, say, a national mail-order catalog or internet business. 
However, because Wal-Marts sell locally they are advertising locally, nationally. In other words; they are advertising to thousands of local communities at the same time, on a national scale. They are also using advertising mechanisms which are far more powerful than anything a small business can compete with. 
Wal-Mart also has the advantage of the rather mobile population it serves. If you live near or in any major or moderate (even many small) population centers you are near a Wal-Mart, it is familiar to you. All of the small, local businesses in the area are unknown. Most people, of course, go to familiar places. The effect is rather obvious; people are habituated into going to Wal-Mart because of familiarity, branding, and the tendency of these and other machinations to push small businesses out of the market. 
Small businesses are left with newspapers, fliers, small signs, canvassing, and (sometimes) small television spots. In the market, though, these are like taking B.B. guns to a nuclear war. The sophistication and reach of the national brands is spectacular and compounding; I can't believe this concept is lost on you. 
2. There are large, gaping, fundamental holes in your consumerist logic. The following statement is rather telling in both what it implies and what it leaves out:
""As I said, ultimately the consumer decides, and they in the mass, always decide toward the company that gives the best quality and quantity for the least cost (which is usually the larger businesses). This is the nature of competition, and very basic economic theory.""
Not only is it well established that logic and reason have little to do with the bulk of purchases (if it did we'd see the entire advertising industry bankrupted); you are leaving out values beyond simple price vis a vis quantity. Things cost more than their price and most people don't factor in the social, environmental, and ""economic"" cost of purchasing a particular good or service. 
Lemme' give you some info you knock out your logical consumer theory:
<a href='http://www.smartmoney.com/theproshop/index.cfm?story=20070322'>http://www.smartmoney.com/theproshop/index.cfm?story=20070322</a>
<a href='http://www.nationalbusiness.org/NBAWEB/Newsletter2005/1099.htm'>http://www.nationalbusiness.org/NBAWEB/Newsletter2005/1099.htm</a>
It's always funny to me that you have to use biased sources from your side to back up your arguments while I can find sources from your own side to back me up.
People are not going for the best quality versus cost, some might, but quality is extremely subjective anyways. People regularly buy cigarettes, drugs, alcohol, fattening food, as I said before they'd buy poison if the price was right. (and they used to, before the FDA was a working organization..well...I mean...we still do.). We buy harmful materials, consume them, and allow them to kill us for seconds of pleasure; not entirely logical, is it? 
People will buy houses without any money; they'll choose gambling over the electricity bill, they'll choose meth over food. Where is your logical consumer? I am still trying to find this most mythical of beasts.
3. What Wal-Mart did was a good thing, though they supported and continue to support the political administration that caused such a tremendous screw-up. 
The government is perfectly capable of doing what Wal-Mart did, for free (it made a profit from its activities, after all). What Wal-Mart did was not a result of market forces, though, according to this study:
<a href='http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Insurance/InsureYourHome/'>http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Insurance/InsureYourHome/</a>
RealKatrinaHeroWalMartStudySays.aspx
It was local and it had the resources to act; we could just as easily have a government entity run on a decentralized plan (such as the successful coast guard depicted in the story) than a for-profit company that still does more harm than good (they, again, helped put us in that position in the first place). 
To sum up, small businesses may not be able to handle regional disasters (though they could if they coordinated under a larger entity); we have a Federal Government which is supposed to do that. Unfortunately, because of the influence of businesses like Wal-Mart we have conservative, anti-government politicians who utterly ruin our government's ability to function. 
By the way, I live in the State of Missouri, a state (along with Iowa, Illinois, and others) being hit by the recent flooding of the Mississippi. The government has performed well; we havn't seen half the damage since the government-built levees were constructed after the great flood of 93'. It's a wonderful counter-example of how government (a cooperation of State, local, and Federal) can fix problems and saves lives/property. 
4. ""Hopefully not without suing the making for fraud.""
It's hard to sue after you're dead. It's also hard to sue with a weak government and a low-paid lawyer backing you up against a billion-dollar company and its cadre of high-priced lawyers. 
5. I've already established that when large-scale businesses take over a given market ingenuity slows. Ideas that small businesses had that could improve our lives would be lost when they go under. 
You also can't actually believe that people are making the best possible decisions when it comes to purchasing. Only if people knew every single one of the choices available to them, were able to carefully weigh each one, and then make a decision could you even plausibly say that. We all know that that is completely impossible.
What's strange to me is that you aren't worried about the problem of corporate domination from a Libertarian perspective. Did you not notice that the result of big corporations knocking down small businesses you'll see an ever-decreasing number of entrepreneurs, small property and capital owners? Essentially, you are supporting the elimination of individual private property for corporate private property; where most land and business is owned by a few large corporations. 
Besides that effect, we also have the internally destructive effect of non-productive culture. Because Wal-Mart and the like sell mostly foreign made, cheap goods they not only destroy small businesses locally but destroy domestic manufacturing nationally. 
Our goods cannot compete, price-wise, with goods from slave, sweatshop, and child-labor from overseas. As a result, we see more and more factories close down, more and more people needing cheaper goods, which means more shopping at Wal-Mart, which means even less demand for domestic goods and so on and so forth. 
All the while the money is being taken out of our local communities and sent to the HQs of the corporate behemoths and the piggy-banks of their CEOs. 
That billion-dollar account a Wal-Mart exec has could be a few thousand dollars in thousands to millions of people's accounts spread out across the country. (again, with all of this money moving out of the community there is even less to spend on small businesses nearby). 
But oh, they are ruining our economy, sending millions of people into poverty, supporting and expanding child-labor, and putting into power corrupt and inept politicians with their campaign contributions but at least they helped some people (for a profit) during hurricane Katrina. 
6. Well I am glad you admit the market shouldn't decide everything. 
7. ""Since that time government has only grown bigger and bigger, with devastating effects.""
It seems that the larger the government grows the larger our economy. At the very least the massive growth in our government's size since WWII hasn't stopped phenomenal economic development in the United States and Western Europe. But let's not get muddied with facts. 
First off; your explanation for the great Depression is nauseatingly simplistic and baffling inept. ""There was a run on the bank and the Fed didn't print money to save the economy...somehow"".
Really, that simple? There was a massive, random run on the bank due to what? Just A BANK? Have you been paying attention in your history classes sweetheart? 
For one thing; the people that told the Fed to act so ridiculously were the people in charge of the economy, the capitalists. They didn't want government intervention in their affairs; they are the ones that told the Fed not to act. (but, again, it's 100% the government's fault..and not just the administration, the entire concept of government caused the Great Depression). 
Secondly, the run on the banks came from the panic, which followed on the heels of the Stock Market crash. 
Here's the thing, I've been reading up on where you got the monetarist explanation for the Great Depression. In fact; I am going to start a Great Depression thread on its own because this is a rather fascinating topic of discussion. 
I suppose we'll have to duke it out over here (once I've had the bloody time to research other parts of this debate):
<a href='http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/What_Caused_the_Great_Depression_(Mostly'>http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                       What_Caused_the_Great_Depression_(Mostly) </a>)
8. For one, the fact remains that there is a creative stifling effect in large companies; I didn't say that it was impossible to overcome; but it is a major problem. That was my whole bloody point. I also didn't say large companies don't innovate, they just innovate at a much slower rate than smaller companies...but no matter to you. You can just make up my arguments as you go along.
The article, in its first three paragraphs, states exactly this. It indicates that such stifling tendencies are possible to overcome, but it recognizes the problem I identified (while you pretend it doesn't exist.)
The rest of this is going to have to be completed later or in other debates. I don't have the time to finish at this point. It's midnight already and I need to work in the morning. Didn't want to leave you hanging though; it'd be cruel to withhold fresh meat from a starving dog.","<b>However, because Wal-Marts sell locally they are advertising locally, nationally. In other words; they are advertising to thousands of local communities at the same time, on a national scale. They are also using advertising mechanisms which are far more powerful than anything a small business can compete with.</b>
The point I was making, and think I made, was that their advertisement advantage is not that much greater because though their message reaches a greater audience, it reaches in practical terms, the same audience locally as a local business can. You also give me the impression t hat you believe humans are very naive. Wal-mart has a higher budget, for sure, but fundamentally people respond to substance and not flashy lights. You haven't been tricked by the green screens and CGI, and using you as a high bar for nativity, I believe the average Joe sees through it too.
Either way, your point on advertisement doesn't have any merit, for it doesn't drain business in a way that is measurable -- at least in theory: Wal-mart has a larger supply then a local business, thus their ad budget is proportionate. In my town there are numerous stores that have no TV advertisement whatsoever, and they operate at full production. This is all kind of a silly thing to argue over, because ultimately Wal-mart has the right to obligation to advertise at full strength, and if a store or two goes-under because of it then they should take responsibility for not getting the word out that their prices are lower etc. This seems terribly unlikely though.
<b>All of the small, local businesses in the area are unknown.</b>
Evidently the word ""local"" escapes you. To help you understand, foreign is it's antonym. You're really stretching to make your argument. Towns and cities depend on local business, and it therefore perplexes me that this whole time they haven't been able to find them.
<b>The sophistication and reach of the national brands is spectacular and compounding; I can't believe this concept is lost on you.</b>
Even if this were super relevant on a micro scale, many of the local businesses in my area are franchises. They might sell cars or food, but they get the luxury of selling recognized brands. Come to think of it, the tiny general store I bike to sells recognized brands too.
<b>Not only is it well established that logic and reason have little to do with the bulk of purchases (if it did we'd see the entire advertising industry bankrupted); you are leaving out values beyond simple price vis a vis quantity.

Sure, people impulse buy. They also don't always acts rationally like the game theorists would like. However, I don't consider them imbeciles. I think the consumer will make their own decision and that the emergent effect will be rational, i.e. with what the market predicts. At least that's what history has shown. 
Those two links you give me are rather laughable. The first illustrates the well known phenomenon of impulse buying, which the evolutionary psychologists predicted long before that particular study was released. However, chocolates is a rather dubious thing to use. I suspect the the same facts aren't as true for buying a new car, house, computer, furnace, or anything else of considerable cost.
These are the heaviest attacks against capitalism you can make? It seems like nit picking when compared to the big picture. That big picture being the huge successes of capitalism and privatization to raise people out of poverty and let them lead a better life. The welfare state of the socialists is infeasible on a micro psychological scale, as well as on the macro economic scale. And without offering an alternative?
<b>It's always funny to me that you have to use biased sources from your side to back up your arguments while I can find sources from your own side to back me up.</b>
I'll ignore the paradox in that. The red herring should not be ignored. In fact, it should be underlined. My sources are scholarly and empirical. The ideology associated with them is by in large irrelevant to the facts they lay out. Instead of attacking the man, attack the facts, so long as you want to remain logically cohesive.

No it isn't. That why I don't do any drugs myself, and take medication only as a last resort. However, I would never advocate telling a person what he or she should do with their body. People have a personal responsibility and that is their main prerogative. I actually do not support the war on drugs at all, and favour complete legalization. Same with foods. So long as it is advertised that food X contains unhealthy fats, then it is up to the individual to decide whether she wants X or Y. It's called freedom. 
<b>People will buy houses without any money; they'll choose gambling over the electricity bill, they'll choose meth over food. Where is your logical consumer?</b>
The meth addicts and the people directly effected by the housing crisis are a minority. Even so, capitalism is a system that gives a person the capacity for success. Likewise, it will give them a capacity for failure. I think that it is elementary of a free society that a person should fail if they do things that are risky or stupid. Luckily for them, in a capitalist society the wealth of all classes, poor included, increases incrementally. 
<b>It was local and it had the resources to act; we could just as easily have a government entity run on a decentralized plan (such as the successful coast guard depicted in the story) than a for-profit company that still does more harm than good (they, again, helped put us in that position in the first place).</b>
Um... again the links you cite in support of your argument come to the opposite conclusion. :P 
From the article: ""It's not the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A new study suggests Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Lowe's would be a lot more helpful. 
Examining federal and private responses to Hurricane Katrina, the study says why FEMA was destined to fail and why for-profit companies succeeded at disaster recovery.""
Also notice that when it mentions the Coast Guard (which is like a police or military service and therefore, in my opinion, should be governmental) it says ""It also looks at the Coast Guard -- the <i>only</i> federal agency lauded for its Katrina performance...""
""Profit-seeking firms beat most of the government to the scene and provided more effectively the supplies needed for the immediate survival of a population cut off from life's most basic necessities,"" Horwitz wrote in the study.
I don't doubt that the state can help, like it did in Missouri. I am not an anarchist. I'm just a capitalist. Nevertheless, I find it ironic that you use levees as a pro after mentioning Hurricane Katrina. I think in many cases, private industry can do a better job than government bureaus. I don't think the government is completely inept. Levees in your area apparently did their job. I simply will say that private industry does a much better job. Like Horowitz says in the link you gave: """"Disaster response happens at the local level,"" Horwitz said. ""FEMA is not local to anyone except people who live in Washington, D.C."" And like Friedman explains, when talking about how private enterprise can fix Central Park: <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PaN9M4WwHw'>2:05</a>
<b>It's hard to sue after you're dead. It's also hard to sue with a weak government and a low-paid lawyer backing you up against a billion-dollar company and its cadre of high-priced lawyers.</b>
It's called tort law. 
<b>I've already established that when large-scale businesses take over a given market ingenuity slows.</b> 
When? The link you gave be earlier showed not that it slowed by that A) corporate bureaucracy helps innovation and B) innovation is best when it is innovative, like when Apple crossed into the digital music industry.
<b>Essentially, you are supporting the elimination of individual private property for corporate private property; where most land and business is owned by a few large corporations.</b>
You mean like the federal government? They own around 25% of the land in America. They should only own, in my opinion, the land that their government buildings are on. And corporate private property? In the first place, corporations, again, don't own anything. Stock holders, employees, customers, and a few executives own corporate land collectively. In the second place, the system that would allow your unfounded anxiety of corporately owned property is the system we are currently under. You are making a prediction of the effects of what I am advocating when what I am advocating is by in large currently in place. Your predictions still miss the mark! This proves once and for all that anti-capitalists can't see whats right in front of their eyes. The only changes in this regard that I favour is removing government from business. That in no way makes it easier for corporations or governments to control us as individuals. It makes it considerably harder, and considerably less profitable. Moreover, corporate welfare is not something any libertarian advocates. Libertarian free-market institutes like <a href='http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8230'>Cato</a>, for example, are vehemently against corporate welfare.
<b>All the while the money is being taken out of our local communities and sent to the HQs of the corporate behemoths and the piggy-banks of their CEOs.</b>
Such convoluted cynicism. ""The piggy-banks of their CEOs."" Give me a break. Most profit goes to the share holders, mutual funds and reinvestment. I challenge you to find me a single successful company that doesn't reinvest more than 80% of their profits.
<b>It seems that the larger the government grows the larger our economy. At the very least the massive growth in our government's size since WWII hasn't stopped phenomenal economic development in the United States and Western Europe.</b>

Re-read my last statement. Your thinking about it backwards. It is the mothers choice whether or not they bring a child into this world. It's her body.

<b>Would you believe something that you read in a scientific journal?</b> 
It depends on many factors, such as the credibility of the journal, the credibility of the person doing the study, the details of the the study and how conclusive the results of the study are. If it something that has an impact on my life, then I would not take it at face value. I would check to see if the results of the study have been peer reviewed, what methodologies were used, and if there were any other studies that confirmed or contradicted their findings. If it was something that has no impact on my life, then I would simply regard it as an interesting piece of information but remain somewhat agnostic on the results until further independent studies are done confirming the results. Keep in mind that not everything in a scientific journal is labeled as 100% conclusive fact. Scientific journals contain many studies that just show preliminary results and require further testing to draw a definitive conclusions. Many articles may just be a hypothesis a scientist has about something. Not everything in science is black and white with 100% conclusive results. The conclusiveness of studies can range anywhere from 0% to 100%. Scientists are frequently working with limited amounts of data and have to do the best with what they have. When more data becomes available, then they run more tests. 
<b>Faith is the only mode of reasoning that we have.</b>
Since you said ""Common sense validates your definitions in this case"" I assume that means you accept my definition of faith, ""belief that is not based on proof"". Please correct me if I'm wrong.

On the flip-side, to believe there is an all-powerful, all-knowing being that transcends time and space, created an entire universe in just a few days, and can read the minds of everyone on Earth at the same time requires a tremendous amount of faith. If I were to tell a theist that I have a dog that can fly, they would think I'm crazy and demand proof. Yet a flying dog is far more believable than the all-powerful being I just described. I don't understand why theists think atheists are so unreasonable for wanting proof, when they themselves want proof for much simpler things.

Good, but you seem to be the exception to the rule because many Christians do.
<b>Why do you use something you don't believe in attempt to prove your point.</b>
I already explained why, but I'll see if I can make it more clear. Since we both provided different definitions of faith we need to figure out which definition matches the context of this debate. Since this debate is about religious faith we should use the definition of faith that is tied to religion. The dictionary definition I provided matches the definition provided by your religious book, and the definition you provided does not. So since this is a debate about religious faith, we should use the definition that matches the religious defintion.
It seems pretty clear that you don't want me to use the Biblical definition because it agrees with the definition I used from the dictionary, and shows that faith and reason are not compatible. You would rather use a definition that doesn't match the context of the debate topic. Watch the first 30 seconds of the video in the description of the debate and tell me which of our definitions you think matches the context of the debate. 
Let's take a look at the definition you provided again. ""allegiance to duty or a person : loyalty."" Now lets plug the key words from your definition into the debate title. ""Are allegiance/loyalty and reason compatible?"" How does that debate topic make any sense using your definition? Allegianc and reason have absolutely nothing to do with each other.
<b>I asked this because you said,"" None of the words in the Biblical definition can be translated as ""allegiance"" to match your definition."" 
Allegiance: 2: devotion or loyalty to a person, group, or cause 
Since when has any religious person not a devotion to a cause?</b> 
I never said religious people are not devoted to a cause. I said the word ""allegiance"" doesn't match any of the words in the Biblical definition of faith. The two key words in the Biblical definition were ""confidence"" and ""assurance"". The word ""allegiance"" does not match either of those words. Let's compare the words, starting with ""confidence"".
Allegiance: Devotion or loyalty to a person, group, or cause. <a href='http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/allegiance'>http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/allegiance </a>
Confidence: A relation of trust or intimacy; the quality or state of being certain <a href='http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/confidence'>http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/confidence </a>
I think the key word in the definition of confidence is ""trust"". Let me know if you disagree. Trust is not the same as devotion or loyalty. I can trust someone without being loyal or devoted to them, so those words are not synonymous. 
Now let's compare ""allegiance"" with ""assurance"".
Assurance: The state of being assured.
Assured: Characterized by certainty or security
I can be certain of something without being loyal or devoted to it. Again, the words are not synonymous.
<b>Why do you not treat the Bible in the same regards. It may only a hypothesis or any range up to 100% It is you that makes the Bible more creditable by using it.</b>
That is how I treat it, but that is not how most Christians treat it. They base their lives around what it says and try to force other people to obey what it says. 
<b>Just google the synonyms for faith and you'll find my definition.</b>
I never argued that your definition was not a real definition. I'm saying it doesn't fit the context of this particular debate.
<b>I'm open-minded, how about you?</b>
Yes, I am open-minded. That's why I've changed my view on many things in life, because I listened to all sides of the story and weighed the arguments and evidence for each side. That's why I went from a Mormon to a non-denominational Christian to an agnostic and finally to an agnostic atheist. I studied each position in depth. The more I studied the more it led me to the conclusion that religion is man-made. If I wasn't open-minded I would never have changed.",4.0
171,./to_process\debate.show.Are_flat_taxes_the_best_system_lj.xml,Are flat taxes the best system?,"I don't think a single home being has ever enjoyed paying taxes of any kind, but I would rather have a progressive tax then a regressive or flat tax. A progressive tax gives incentive to donating to charities, and although I wish it wasn't the case, a lot of wealthy people only donate for the sake of those tax breaks. Does that make their donations selfish? Yes. Do I think it matters? No. What difference does it make if a cure to AIDS is found because Bill Gates donated money for a tax break? Do you think the millions of people that have AIDS care? Does it matter if Bill Gates gives computers to schools in order to get a tax break?
We don't live in an ideal world. Sure, it would be better if we could create a flat tax system which neither the poor pay too much, or the rich pays too little. I believe Alex Smith said it best, 
""The necessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor. They find it difficult to get food, and the greater part of their little revenue is spent in getting it. The luxuries and vanities of life occasion the principal expense of the rich, and a magnificent house embellishes and sets off to the best advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which they possess. A tax upon house-rents, therefore, would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be anything very unreasonable. It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion.""","I know I said the previous statement was my final question but there is a obvious a difference of opinion on taxes and donating.
<b>Does that make their donations selfish? Yes. Do I think it matters? No</b>
To me, it does matter because the only reason people donate is due to their own selfish wants and needs. 
Finally, what about tax loopholes under the most complex progressive tax in the world?
Top 10 Examples of Progressive Tax Loopholes. [1] If the rich have the ability to pay, you noted that then they should pay. Billions of dollars of taxes are lost due to loopholes and they are not even donating.
On the other hand, in a flat tax, it would be different. ""One low income tax rate paid by all but the poorest wage-earners, who are exempt. No loopholes for the rich to exploit. No graduated rates that take a higher percentage of income from people who work hard to earn more. No need for a huge bureaucracy to police fiendishly complex tax laws."" [2] Imagine the U.S. without IRS agents.
Lastly, did you mean Adam Smith and not Alex Smith. Alex Smith is a football player.

We have investigated it and debunked some, but also acknowledged not knowing the truth about others. And i damn sure know it could very well be a mixture of psychology and natural causes.

It could be an interesting thing to investigate. Why do people keep having experiences in the same locations over and over? Why do photographs in these places show certain anomolies that cant be recreated there intentionally or anywhere else? Ghosts? No, probably not. But i think its interesting to see what it would be.

Not true. Ive heard many different theories. One of course being that they are a mixture of psychological misinterpretation of sensory information and uncommon natural causes (like wierd light reflections or electrical malfunctions and such). And another that says ""ghosts"" are just imprints of energy on quantum space or something. Its pretty complicated. You can look it up.

I changed it to this, the weapon isn't dangerous because it can't do harm but the act of using the weapon is because that's really the only place anything can be done. in an act.
For the second part, based off of my initial argument, any unstable material is dangerous, it can do harm at anytime </b>
I'm saying that any reasoning to why something is dangerous can be good reasoning, of course there is bot only <i>how something is dangerous</i> but <i>how dangerous something is</i> a pencil can be a dangerous thing, but not nearly as dangerous as a gun. You can redefign your opinion of dangerous as simply anything that has the intent to hurt you, or simply acts themselves. All you are doing is excluding one qualifier of <i>dangerous</i> for absolutely no reason. I don't lack a reason to consider guns dangerous since they make others dangerous makes themselves dangerous. That qualifier of <i>dangerous</i> is a reason in itself, and I haven't heard a good reason for it to not be considered a good reason. The only opposing reason you have given me is reason enough to say that guns <i>by themselves</i> aren't dangerous, which I agreed with all along. 
<b> For the third part, it's not that I don't see them as logically it's that i see them as obviously stated by society which got me to thinking. ""Is it really the object or is it the person using the object"" as i said above though, I now have a new way of thinking. The age old ""Is a pencil dangerous"" comparison being used, we could say logically it's not. Then again, it's dangerous for a baby to hold it, I use pencils everyday, but i don't want a baby playing with anything that it could hurt itself on. Obviously the baby could hurt it's self on anything in the house, but that doesn't make anything in the house dangerous do you think, I ask honestly?</b>
It can sometimes be the person, object, <i>and</i> the act. Sometimes just one, or just two, you can measure danger by how much. A pencil isn't very dangerous, as the amount of deaths by pencils isn't nearly as much deaths by guns, which compared to the gun the pencil <i>isn't</i> dangerous, however everything and anything is ""dangerous"". Drawing with a pencil isn't dangerous, unless its a baby drawing, however your opinion that a baby is dangerous may radically change if it lacks possession of a pencil. A person isn't necessarily dangerous without a weapon. So does that mean I can say no being is ever dangerous and only objects are dangerous? Since the amount of <i>dangerous</i> a criminal is changes when he lacks or possesses a gun, however the criminal is still dangerous. See how being so nitpicky about what can be considered dangerous can be?","<b>The only opposing reason you have given me is reason enough to say that guns by themselves aren't dangerous, which I agreed with all along.</b>

<b>I don't lack a reason to consider guns dangerous since they make others dangerous makes themselves dangerous. That qualifier of dangerous is a reason in itself, and I haven't heard a good reason for it to not be considered a good reason.</b>
I remain that a thing that can't act on it's own isn't dangerous. if it can't influence without being influenced, i also remain that it's instead the influence itself that is dangerous, no the object that was influenced. Which is where I move back up to my starting argument of objects not being dangerous on their own.
<b>however everything and anything is ""dangerous"".</b>
maybe taken out of context but it seems like you say that everything is dangerous, I say nothing is dangerous it's the way things are used that makes them dangerous, this is because the so called dangerous things, which could be anything as we both agree, isn't doing harm on it's own. The person using them to, or the force making them is.
<b>A person isn't necessarily dangerous without a weapon. So does that mean I can say no being is ever dangerous and only objects are dangerous?</b>
I think that is a false statement, there's enough martial arts on the planet to qualify people as dangerous based on your principles of what is dangerous, but would you personally say martial arts is dangerous? I wouldn't, I'd say that using it is.

That comes back to the gray area, but yes I do. that is why i soundly believe in no object, I will count people as an object for the purpose of drawing a line, no object as dangerous. Just the actions these objects take, though not every action is dangerous the dangerous ones used to harm are.
It gets down to a point where eventually I'd be saying people aren't dangerous, the body isn't dangerous the mind isn't dangerous it's the act of having the thought to harm that's dangerous, and sure it's tedious but I like to put specifics on things like that.

Dangerousis subjective meaning that you can argue anything is dangerous, just like you can argue anything is <i>cool</i> or <i>lame</i>.

Why? Why only people and acts? That's what I've been waiting to hear. You make the argument that nothing on It's own can be dangerous, I make the argument back that things can be dangerous in the sense they make others dangerous. This has where it ended as far as I seen. My logic of how objects are dangerous refutes your logic to how they are not, yet I have yet to see a refutation of my refutation. This has how it is gone to me:
""Are guns dangerous?""
Me: yes, of course.
You: no, because they aren't dangerous on their own, people who use them to cause harm are dangerous.
Me: making guns dangerous in the sense they make others dangerous
You: guns aren't dangerous on their own, people who use them to harm others are dangerous
Me: making guns dangerous in the sense they make others dangerous
Etc etc etc... It just keeps repeating...
Is their a miscommunication or what is going on here?
I am trying to argue they are dangerous even if it is indirectly dangerous.
<b> I think that is a false statement, there's enough martial arts on the planet to qualify people as dangerous based on your principles of what is dangerous, but would you personally say martial arts is dangerous? I wouldn't, I'd say that using it is.</b>
Indirectly, yes... Especially if MMA is often used to harm people, if it isn't then I say no because it isn't dangerous enough for me to personally consider it dangerous. <i>EVERYTHING</i> is dangerous, but what we all call <i>personally</i> dangerous often depends on how dangerous any sort of particular thing. EVERYTHING is addictive but some things are MORE addictive than other things soda is <i>addictive</i> but not in the sense meth is.

None taken, and of course not. What I am saying though is that dangerous is a state of mind, mindless objects can't have.
<b>What, at least, I think we have been arguing, is whether or not one can say objects are dangerous, not whether or not objects are dangerous on their own. </b>
That is it, and I am beginning to believe it's a moot point. My mind is set on the idea that if the object can't do harm without physical interaction then it's not dangerous. That is why I <i>do</i> believe unstable objects and thing set to detonate are dangerous.
<b>And I am arguing there is nothing illogical to say that they are, even if it is dangerous in the sense that they make others dangerous, I haven't heard a logic against that. The debate like I said before isn't ""are guns dangerous on their own?""</b>
Although the object can be used as a dangerous one, anything can. The main reason I rest on this side is because I don't want to say everything is dangerous, but since anything can be used dangerously, everything must be.
<b>Dangerous is subjective meaning that you can argue anything is dangerous</b>
True, all too true. I feel that the simple fact that the object on it's own can't do harm, makes it not dangerous. You feel that if the object has potential to do harm it's dangerous, but not that everything is dangerous.
<b>Why only people and acts? That's what I've been waiting to hear. You make the argument that nothing on It's own can be dangerous, I make the argument back that things can be dangerous in the sense they make others dangerous.</b>
Actions are dangerous because that's where any harm can occur. I feel the things can't be dangerous just because they make others dangerous because anything can make someone more dangerous. In fact everything does, just in way varying degrees. A man with a teddy bear is more dangerous than a man without just as a man with a gun is more dangerous than a man with a teddy bear.
<b>I say no because it isn't dangerous enough for me to personally consider it dangerous.</b>
It seems that it's not whether or not they are dangerous is actually our argument, but instead it's a thresh hold for us.
I set my thresh hold at 0% since I believe objects don't do harm alone.
You set yours at death or serious injury, which is why you say a pencil isn't dangerous, but agree that a baby with a pencil is dangerous.
<b>And I'm being specific that things can be indirectly dangerous, or directly dangerous. It seems to you that things are only dangerous or not dangerous, there is no indirect.</b>
Yes, basically I'd rather not go into indirects again for all the possibilities like pencils with babies, or elderly with dry foods.
As an end to this, I think what we can agree on is that danger comes in levels and what we would say for society is dangerous is death or injury and the definition of danger is set at 'normal' people, not babies or handicapped.",4.0

In birds where mortality rates are pretty bad, ""gay"" traits have been known to show themselves. The male birds that are born later will not go out and find mates, but stay home with the sisters and help raise their babies. So, the male bird doesn't pass on its genes directly, but it helps the other family members pass on theirs and a gay gene can survive that way.

Heterosexual orientation, on the other hand, is naturally built - in, and is not an addiction in itself (that doesn't mean it can't become an addiction, especially in todays sexed up society). It can also be directly controlled by willpower, at least for men - this is why it's much easier for a man to become a monk, than for a woman. Also kundalini is based on cultivating this healthy energy, something that is absolutely impossible for male homosexuals. (For women I believe the equation is very different).</b>

Link to addiction: the behavior is highly addictive, and gays as a group are much more promiscuous than non - gays. Again, in the 80-s they did not even deny this, but thought of it as proof of their ""freedom"".

<b>Humans haven't drastically changed through their later evolution</b>
Precisely my point. The change is that people who <i>have</i> humanitarian views are no longer killed or imprisoned (at least in the west they aren't). Conversely, in the poorer regions of the world, human rights are severely diminished, with countless abuses and inequalities. Here in the west, where we can easily feed people and in all ways provide for them, it is possible to give everybody rights. As I said, before industrialism increased supply, most people were essentially slaves who were forced to work to provide for the aristocracy. Now that machines can do it, those in power can afford to allow liberty.

I contend that they frequently don't - my evidence also being this site. The number of times I have checked someone's sources and found them to be terribly illegitimate, fallacious, or grossly misrepresented far exceeds that of when the source is credible. I have also only very rarely encountered anyone who has checked my own sources. Given that the majority of debaters themselves are not checking their own sources or those of their opponent, I think it is a very safe conclusion that very, very few observers ever check even some of the sources being cited. There is absolutely no basis to claim that more observers of written debate source check than those observing a live debate, particularly given the prevalence of smart phones for live fact checking.
<i>Second Proposition</i>
Regarding your second proposition, easier does not necessarily make for a better debate or audience experience. The delay in exchanges arguably discourages the following of written debates to begin with, and the more an individual debater is actually gathering appropriate evidence the longer that debate is going to be protracted. By contrast, a live debate has immediate responses. The debaters largely do rely upon their memory; exercising and training recall, and breeding familiarity with key literature and research on a subject hardly seem like weaknesses to me. That live debate requires more effort is strongly indicative of a <i>better</i> debate for the audience and debaters, not a lesser one. 
Further, there is some capacity for live fact checking and research, again via smart phone technology. There is no reason that a wholly illegitimate source should fly under the radar, particularly as a well-researched debater will be familiar with the legitimate sources and a strange source should raise automatic flags. Lacking such live fact checking, it is entirely possible for a debater to include in their counter a note/flag for their audience that the source may not be legitimate and to challenge their opponent to elaborate upon the source further.","<i><b>that they frequently don't</b></i>

184,./to_process\debate.show.Are_live_debates_are_superior_to_written_debates_lj.xml,Are live debates superior to written debates?,"<b>First Proposition</b>
Your initial first proposition was only ""that there is at least some drive to check sources - i'll offer this site or any other written debate site as evidence."" My arguments pertaining to the prevalence of drive were in direct response to that, including my counter example of this forum. Do not insult my integrity on account of your ineptitude in defending your initial assertion. 
You now contend not that written debate is characterized by “some drive to check sources”, but that the drive is comparable for both mediums (a claim you justify not with any actual warrant but in the name of simplicity, but which I shall call either laziness or inability) and that it is the ability to exercise that drive which matters. This is a new argument under the first proposition, and far more closely related to the second where I will henceforth address it.
<b>Second Proposition</b>
Your second proposition has been that it is easier to be more thorough in fact/source/argument checking a written debate. This is an argument of ability. I group your modified observations off of the first proposition here, since they are now effectively the same argument.
You contend that because written debate occurs at the pace of the participants this makes them more able to fact/source/argument check. You have furnished no proof that the pace of a written debate compliments that of its observers. I contend that observers are perfectly capable of live debate source checking, and further note that most live debates are officially recorded (and all may be recorded by the observer) for later review. Further, I contend that in written debate the delay between responses actually discourages continued observance of the debate altogether; it is too <i>slow</i>. You end up with no external source or fact checking because you have no observers (or at the very best, far fewer). As mentioned previously, this is paired with a diminished capacity for internal fact and source checking due to the debaters' lesser familiarity with the subject in written debate.
You have additionally contended that: <i>In my experience the success of live examination depends highly on the material being debated (and, of course, the skill of the debaters.)& I think here is where we may have a genuine point of disagreement. In a written debate, the other party can request the source, examine it, and respond accordingly.</i>
The success of written examination depends highly on the material and skill of the debaters as well; no one is going to endure a protracted written debate or critically examine it if they are unfamiliar with the material, if the material is poorly presented, or the debaters inept. This is non-unique, and also a non-response to my point that debaters can call themselves out on sources at least as much as in written debate. For instance, in a live debate, the other party can also request the source, examine it, and respond accordingly. That is non-unique. What is different is that there is more pressure in a live debate to actually share the source, and less capacity to backtrack if caught off-guard when using illegitimate sources. Accountability is higher in live debate.
<i><b>Regarding the weighing criteria for this debate</b></i>
<b>Qualified Sense of Experience [and] “I have said twice now […] I do not believe it possible to say that either format is objectively better at all times and for all participants.”</b>
And as I have already said, this is a misrepresentation of my argument entirely. My point was that your “qualified sense of experience” assumes a number of things: (1) that ease of observance is a legitimate concern and criteria for assessing superiority of medium; and (2) that you have consistently assumed that your own preferences and abilities are reflective of the majority of observers in most circumstances.
The question is not one of universal superiority, but of probabilistic superiority. My arguments against the qualified sense of experience are that your standards for assessing that probable superiority are themselves potentially invalid assumptions; therefore unless you demonstrate their validity as criteria even winning an argument on them has no weight.","<u>First Proposition</u>
There is some drive to check sources.
Its relative preponderance in each medium is unimportant as to the claim as long at it exists for each. Surely you do not contend that <i><b>no one ever</b></i> desires to research the validity of claims made and their sources.
<i><b>This is a new argument under the first proposition</b></i>
The first was, and remains, only preamble for the second.

<i><b>This is an argument of ability</b></i>
Ability within time. A debater with equivalent ability in all respects except source analysis within a short time frame is at a disadvantage in a live debate, but on equal footing in a written one.

Is this something that needs proved? Do you not agree that the observer is generally not in control of the pace of a live debate?
<i><b>this is paired with a diminished capacity for internal fact and source checking due to the debaters' lesser familiarity with the subject in written debate.</b></i>
The debater's lesser familiarity may be more probable, but is not guaranteed. Additionally, the quality of the response by a debater with lesser familiarity may, with additional time, meet or exceed the quality of the response by a more familiar live debater. Moreover, the additional capacity for internal fact and referenced source checking is asserted to be conveyed upon the audience as well as the debater. 
<i><b>The success of written examination</b></i> and <i><b>debaters can call themselves out on sources at least as much as in written debate</b></i>
The success of any examination of novel material in some subjects may require time. In a written debate, taking 30 minutes to thoroughly review a source is generally trivial whereas it would nearly always be prohibitive within a live debate.
<i><b>I contend that observers are perfectly capable of live debate source checking</b></i>
Live debate source checking detracts attention from the ongoing debate; source checking within written debate allows the participant to do the analysis and resume in place.
<i><b>most live debates are officially recorded (and all may be recorded by the observer)</b></i>
If you want to assert that a live debate with good debaters which is posted freely as video and with a correct transcript is a really good thing for a majority of interested people a majority of the time, you will get no argument from me. However, I believe that to be a far more qualified assertion than one of objective medium superiority.
<i><b>I contend that in written debate the delay between responses actually discourages continued observance of the debate altogether;</b></i>
This is not a response to the added ability of those that <i>are</i> sufficiently interested and is just another in a myriad of factors that support the contention that the effect of the medium is a subjective one rather than one which can be proved objectively.
<i><b>there is more pressure in a live debate to actually share the source, and less capacity to backtrack if caught off-guard when using illegitimate sources. Accountability is higher in live debate.</b></i>
How's that?
<u>Subjective Expreience</u>
<i><b>(1) that ease of observance is a legitimate concern and criteria for assessing superiority of medium;</b></i>
Do you contend that it is not? No definition or restriction was given for ""superiority"", so I believe all attributes to be relevant to the discussion. 
<i><b>(2) that you have consistently assumed that your own preferences and abilities are reflective of the majority of observers in most circumstances.</b></i>
It does not need to reflect the majority in order to be true for some and make the question a subjective one.
<i><b>The question is not one of universal superiority, but of probabilistic superiority.</b></i>
I believe it to be more of a question of superiority for each individual at any given time. 
There are lots of reasons people will use to choose the venue of their debate. People just getting into debate, debaters with social phobias or speech impediments, debaters who normally participate in live debates but want to experiment with a line of reasoning, people looking to debate something at 3 in the morning, or with people in another country, etc., etc. may all decide that written debate is a better medium for any given instance. The sustained existence of sites like this one shows that some debate participants at times prefer to participate in this format.",4.0

I'd argue WWI and WWII were more than justifiable, and calling Iraq II on both parties is ridiculous.

<b>They'd take up arms tomorrow if they were resurrected and saw a $3.5 trillion dollar budget and a progressive income tax that isn't even enough to pay it.</b>
As a percent of GDP the U.S. has one of the lowest, or the lowest debt of any nation. We're actually doing awesome in that area. You've fallen for the strawman, odd for one claiming it is everyone else who does not know what is going on.
The only issue effecting economy right now is jobs. One of the most effective ways to create jobs is through government spending, and it happens to be the only effective way of creating jobs during a major recession. 
So, being the smart people they were (the founders), once they studied up on modern society I'm confident the majority of the founders would support increased government spending in order to create more jobs. Things like fixing roads, super fast trains, more teachers and better qualified teachers, things of that nature. All easily paid for with a return to the 90's tax rates, you remember, when a Democratic president created the most successful U.S. economy in history?

The problem with this notion is that nobody's personality is such as entirely benefits them. I, for example, have an unmercifully short temper. Thus your definition would, again, label everybody a sufferer of some syndrome or other.
<b>The second part is about the control over the said variation. The person with the variation of personality is not able to control his variation of personality to successfully cope with every day life.</b>
Case example: homosexuality. Not a syndrome, uncontrollable, and in many cases has been detrimental to the person in question's wellbeing.
<b>As side question to you: what sort of proof would you expect to demonstrate the existence of intangible things such “a thought”, “jealousy”, ”learning process”?</b>
The existence of intangible things cannot, by definition, be incontrovertibly proven. 
<b>...In fact, this is the way scientific discovery is made.</b>

The universe exists. It is observable and, unless one is a metaphysical nihilist, provable. This is your trait (low attention span, boisterousness and what have you).
To say that this universe was created by a benevolent, omnipotent, omniscient God is to invent a means by which an effect may be achieved and to justify the existence of this means by exhibiting the effects it was designed to have.
The same for your syndrome. You have observed traits which may exist independently (viz, a feckless pacifist, a studious rogue <i>et cetera</i>) without being symptoms of a syndrome and inferred that cases in which they occur together (viz, feckless rogues <i>et alia</i>) must be the malefaction of a syndrome.","""shut the fuck up """,1.0

15,./to_process\debate.show.Are_live_debates_are_superior_to_written_debates_lj.xml,Are live debates superior to written debates?,"<b>First Proposition</b>
Your initial first proposition was only ""that there is at least some drive to check sources - i'll offer this site or any other written debate site as evidence."" My arguments pertaining to the prevalence of drive were in direct response to that, including my counter example of this forum. Do not insult my integrity on account of your ineptitude in defending your initial assertion. 
You now contend not that written debate is characterized by “some drive to check sources”, but that the drive is comparable for both mediums (a claim you justify not with any actual warrant but in the name of simplicity, but which I shall call either laziness or inability) and that it is the ability to exercise that drive which matters. This is a new argument under the first proposition, and far more closely related to the second where I will henceforth address it.
<b>Second Proposition</b>
Your second proposition has been that it is easier to be more thorough in fact/source/argument checking a written debate. This is an argument of ability. I group your modified observations off of the first proposition here, since they are now effectively the same argument.
You contend that because written debate occurs at the pace of the participants this makes them more able to fact/source/argument check. You have furnished no proof that the pace of a written debate compliments that of its observers. I contend that observers are perfectly capable of live debate source checking, and further note that most live debates are officially recorded (and all may be recorded by the observer) for later review. Further, I contend that in written debate the delay between responses actually discourages continued observance of the debate altogether; it is too <i>slow</i>. You end up with no external source or fact checking because you have no observers (or at the very best, far fewer). As mentioned previously, this is paired with a diminished capacity for internal fact and source checking due to the debaters' lesser familiarity with the subject in written debate.
You have additionally contended that: <i>In my experience the success of live examination depends highly on the material being debated (and, of course, the skill of the debaters.)& I think here is where we may have a genuine point of disagreement. In a written debate, the other party can request the source, examine it, and respond accordingly.</i>
The success of written examination depends highly on the material and skill of the debaters as well; no one is going to endure a protracted written debate or critically examine it if they are unfamiliar with the material, if the material is poorly presented, or the debaters inept. This is non-unique, and also a non-response to my point that debaters can call themselves out on sources at least as much as in written debate. For instance, in a live debate, the other party can also request the source, examine it, and respond accordingly. That is non-unique. What is different is that there is more pressure in a live debate to actually share the source, and less capacity to backtrack if caught off-guard when using illegitimate sources. Accountability is higher in live debate.
<i><b>Regarding the weighing criteria for this debate</b></i>
<b>Qualified Sense of Experience [and] “I have said twice now […] I do not believe it possible to say that either format is objectively better at all times and for all participants.”</b>
And as I have already said, this is a misrepresentation of my argument entirely. My point was that your “qualified sense of experience” assumes a number of things: (1) that ease of observance is a legitimate concern and criteria for assessing superiority of medium; and (2) that you have consistently assumed that your own preferences and abilities are reflective of the majority of observers in most circumstances.
The question is not one of universal superiority, but of probabilistic superiority. My arguments against the qualified sense of experience are that your standards for assessing that probable superiority are themselves potentially invalid assumptions; therefore unless you demonstrate their validity as criteria even winning an argument on them has no weight.","""Your an idiot...""",1.0

Once people are back on their feet they can, with the same ease, reopen their enterprise without any resistance. 
<i>Also, big corporations can go into a developing area; drop their prices way below the competition (taking a loss) and use the profits from other areas of the country (or world) to wait for the other businesses to go under, close, and then put their prices back up to normal.</i>
It would have to be a very developing area, because the places with the most people unusually have many big retailers like Chapters, Futureshop, Target, Macy's, Barnes & Noble, Old Navy, Winners, and down the list that are all in a sort of competition for the best retailer. In smaller developing areas, where there are admittedly less people effected, what you describe is possible. Again, though, as in my hometown where we basically only have a Wal-mart when it comes to big name suppliers, businesses can always (and always do) reopen once the prices are low. This is a necessary fact for the simple reason that towns need employment -- more than Wal-mart can satisfy. Nevertheless, the stores that Wal-mart ends up shutting down are stores that sell like-goods for higher costs. Niche markets remain open unabated. Again, however unfortunate you wish make this out to be, it was completely determined by consumers democratically moving their business to Wal-mart. 
<i>People will buy discount poison drops if they said ""quality pain killer"" on it.</i>
Hopefully not without suing the making for fraud.
<i>Just because people are making bad choices doesn't mean it legitimizes the choice.</i>
Why are they bad choices? Over all, the existence of a Wal-mart or like business in small communities is indicative of local wealth. In other words, it's a sign of economic health. Just because a few business owners get hurt along the way doesn't make it a bad choice, nor does it negate the fact that it is completely determined my the consumer. All you are doing is describing facts of competition -- a positive trait of capitalism. 
<i> Just because people are willing to buy cheap goods made from children in sweatshops doesn't mean that choice is legitimate and shouldn't be taken away.</i>
Why not? Because of capital flow and economic globalization have caused poverty rates to drop dramatically in places like China, compared to areas less affected by globalization, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, where poverty rates have remained stagnant. I understand the desire for good working conditions in these developing countries, but the simple fact is that if it weren't for the ""sweat shops"" they would be completely jobless. Capitalism with reduced trade barriers stands alone in it's ability to raise people out of poverty, sweat shops being a starting point (in the last 20 years the number of people in developing countries living under $1 a day has dropped from 40% to 20%).
""The percentage of people living on less than $2 a day has decreased greatly in areas effected by globalization, whereas poverty rates in other areas have remained largely stagnant. In East-Asia, including China, the percentage has decreased by 50.1% compared to a 2.2% increase in Sub-Saharan Africa."" So you see what you are characterizing as the problem is in actuality the beginnings of the solution.
<i>People don't have the economic right to preference slavery over freemen factory goods. Are you saying we should legalize slavery and let the market decide?</i>
What a horrible misunderstanding you have of libertarian philosophy. Libertarianism is the anti-thesis of slavery and states that you should be able to express your freedom to the utmost, only so long as your freedoms don't infringe on the freedoms of others. Libertarianism is not a state of anomie. It is not lawless. That state and local governments still define laws within the context of human relation with individual rights being cardinal. The starting rights are your right to life, followed by liberty and the pursuit of happiness, each depending on the preceding right to exist. I have no right, however, to infringe other peoples rights, and that includes through coercion, forced labour, or slavery. Exceptions are abound, but this is the foundation of any free society.
<i>Keynesian, socialist, economics has done wonders for our economy and our standard of living.</i>

<i>How can this be? How can wages be going down by .3 per cent (that's not even factoring in our ever rising inflation) while our productivity, as individuals, has increased 8.4 per cent? Why isn't the market giving back?</i>
I don't quite understand what you're asking, nor does that link you gave me give nearly enough details. However, here are some (i think) relevant things to bare in mind. 'These statistics do not tell the whole story. Taken alone, they portray workers’ living standards in the most negative light possible by ignoring almost a third of what workers earn. Benefits are an increasingly large component of worker compensation and now account for 30 percent of workers’ pay—and this proportion has risen sharply in recent years. Ignoring benefits misses much of what workers actually earn, but that is what the eco­nomic pessimists do.'
'Another of the pessimists’ claims is that workers are being shortchanged because wages have not kept pace with productivity growth.[21] Since 1995, worker productivity has increased rapidly. Employ­ees now produce far more per hour than at any time in the past. According to economic theory, competition should force companies to pass on productivity gains to their workers as higher wages and compensation.'
'However, the current lag in wage growth is not unprecedented; in fact, it is familiar. Wages and productivity often diverge during the course of the business cycle. For example, pro­ductivity grew faster than compensa­tion for several years after the recovery from the 1991 recession. The last reces­sion ended in November 2001, five years ago. At this same point following the end of the 1991 recession, productivity had risen 8.4 percent, while compensation had risen only 5.2 percent.'
'Earnings growth did not match productivity growth in the 1990s until 1997, when the unem­ployment rate fell and companies faced competi­tion to hire increasingly productive workers. As a result, incomes shot up. By 1999, employee com­pensation had fully caught up to the productivity gains of the early 1990s. In the end, income and productivity did move together, but that result took several years to reach.'

I read the beginning of that Forbes article and question whether you actually read it all. The article prefaces the theory that bureaucracy stifles innovation, and then the author of the article goes on to show categorically why this is false. It's almost like what creationists do when they quote Darwin talking about the improbability of the eye evolving... right before he goes on to explain how the eye evolved. Talk about tunnel-vision! In fact, the header on the second page of the article reads ""HOW BUREAUCRACY AIDS INNOVATION"".
<i>Not exactly anti-business organizations, yet they both talk about how large corporations tend to stagnate when it comes to innovation.</i>
Do you have any credibility left? You should that you have no desire to read past the first paragraph, when the last paragraph in the preamble states: ""In the following passages, I will take you through several examples of how bureaucracy and tight controls are facilitating, contributing to, and supporting the innovation efforts in some large, diversified, and well-known corporations.""
Innovation may very well work with bureaucracy, but incentives to innovate are a market force. That's why America has the best health care technology in the world, and why countries with socialized medicine ride on America's back for new advances.
Your other link from portfolio doesn't seem to contradict this either. The author is in fact praising companies like Apple and Wal-Mart. He goes on to explain how companies take over a market they plateau. They have no real reason to innovate, just like a species adapted to its environment has no need to evolve. ""The reward is that they get big. The punishment is that when they get big, it gets harder and harder for them to grow,"" says Grove, which is in essence exactly what I said earlier. It is undesirable for a company to have an absolute monopoly. 
The main purpose of that article is to discuss the theory of ""cross boundary disruption,"" where a corporation diverges from it's normal industry ""with an innovative product or service [to] shake up the status quo and reap big profits."" He cites many examples of this. This is a positive aspect of capitalism and is the opposite of ""yet they both talk about how large corporations tend to stagnate when it comes to innovation.""
<a href='http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/casse/2103'>Commentarymagazine</a> reports, ""The amount Grove is spending is a fraction of what the Gates Foundation has, but you do get the sense that his “creative capitalism” is far more rigorous than what Gates has in mind. For Grove, the problem isn’t the nature of capitalism, it is the lack of contrarian second-guessing within business and governments that is the real enemy of innovation.""
I'm happy to see the things you are citing against capitalism are in fact for capitalism.
<i>First of all, a small government would give even greater power to corporations; without a strong government most decisions would be left up, directly, to those with the most economic power; not indirectly through bribes, lobbying, and campaign funding.</i>
I think I already covered, and indeed economic theorist settled this decades ago, that a companies interest is the consumers interest so long as market forces exist. Big government takes away these market forces, making a company immune, and thus removing the incentive to lower prices and increase quality for market share.
<i>Tell me, how on earth is a politician supposed to get elected without campaign contributions? How on earth are they supposed to get elected without the assistance of mass media? Without support from big business and the media another candidate would simply get in who is.</i>
I agree. The political system is very corruptible in terms of the shady exchange between special interests and politicians. That wouldn't be an issue though, if politicians didn't have such power. It's only under a Keynesian frame of mind that government has exploded in size, especially so under the Bush administration. A limited government would have, of course, limited powers. In my dream world no one person in America would have the power to bomb Iran, or invade a country, or to wire tap, or execute, and so on, thus making it nearly impossible for a single corrupt soul from ruining the country. Of course it is still possible, but much more difficult. 
<i>In other words, there are plenty of honest politicians or people who want to be honest politicians. The problem is that the system rewards the dishonest.</i>
Completely agree. Ironically, this is an argument against decreasing government size and powers, and increasing government transparency. 
<i>We cannot have a Democracy with a small government, we would end up in a true Plutocracy; a society government exclusively by the rich.</i>
You mean like Russia, or China, or North Korea, or Cuba, or Venezuela, or Briton, or Norway, or, pardon me, the United States of America? Do you honestly think the Obamas, Kennedys, Bushes, Clintons etc. are poor? 
No, in a limited government the ruling class is the average citizen. I also, like most libertarians, advocate power being allocated to the 50 states and the states being sovereign. They should be able to create their regulations and bylaws without overruling by federal law (except the constitution) or supreme court ruling, and the ""executive branch"" should probably be removed all together.
This would open up a multiparty system because ideologies are typically geographical (bible belt, North East liberals, etc.). The only reason we have a 2 party system in America now is because the Democratic platform and the Republican platform are vague enough to make all other potential parties (communist, green, libertarian, marijuana) conform. This would make the representative government truly representative. Of course, this is going off topic from capitalism, and I do not speak for all capitalists.
<i>I also wonder why you only see fit to blame politicians and never corporations. Are corporations small children who are just swept up in political corruption by accident? They know exactly what they are doing, they are doing it for their bottom line, and to blame politicians only is to, again, be intellectual dishonest.</i>
I beg to differ. Corporations always want to appeal to three things. The stock holders, their employees, and their customers. This is the break down of the profit motive. So they pursue not technically ""their self interest"". The corporation isn't a person. It is made up of those three parts. So who is to blame? The corporation for pursuing the bottom line for it's components (which runs the economy), or crooked politicians for enabling them to now follow the rules. When discussing cause and effect, it is the new condition that is usually attributed to the cause, be it the finger that pulls the trigger, or the congressmen that opens the door for the special interest?
<i>No matter what political system, big government, small government, monarchy, theocracy, dictatorship...the people who hold economic power hold political power. It's beguiling that you don't seem to recognize this.</i>
What political power, under the system I have described, does the ""big corporation"" have? They don't hold power. They do under the current system. In my system it is the individual who has the power. The citizen. 
<i>People cannot make good, logical decisions when their information is controlled by either political or economic entities with a vested interest in their deception.</i>
Deception is fraud, and there is room under my system for class action law suits. Simply saying ""they will lie for profit"" is not enough. You have to prove that it is feasible that they will lie when the law prohibits it.","""I wouldn't talk APE, you are so dumb you once failed a survey!""",1.0

Either option is vulnerable to coups but it should be obvious that the military option is most susceptible.

Yes and I've agreed with all along... No offense but you can'thonestly think, I'm arguing whether or not objects have a mind of their own. What, at least, I think we have been arguing, is whether or not one can say objects are dangerous, not whether or not objects are dangerous on their own. 
<b> I remain that a thing that can't act on it's own isn't dangerous. if it can't influence without being influenced, i also remain that it's instead the influence itself that is dangerous, no the object that was influenced.

The dabate is ""are guns dangerous?"" And I am arguing there is nothing illogical to say that they are, even if it is dangerous in the sense that they make others dangerous, I haven't heard a logic against that. The debate like I said before isn't ""are guns dangerous on their own?""

Dangerousis subjective meaning that you can argue anything is dangerous, just like you can argue anything is <i>cool</i> or <i>lame</i>.

 harm are.</b>
Why? Why only people and acts? That's what I've been waiting to hear. You make the argument that nothing on It's own can be dangerous, I make the argument back that things can be dangerous in the sense they make others dangerous. This has where it ended as far as I seen. My logic of how objects are dangerous refutes your logic to how they are not, yet I have yet to see a refutation of my refutation. This has how it is gone to me:
""Are guns dangerous?""
Me: yes, of course.
You: no, because they aren't dangerous on their own, people who use them to cause harm are dangerous.
Me: making guns dangerous in the sense they make others dangerous
You: guns aren't dangerous on their own, people who use them to harm others are dangerous
Me: making guns dangerous in the sense they make others dangerous
Etc etc etc... It just keeps repeating...

The characteristic behaviors of a spectrum disorder (like ADD, Autism, schizophrenia…) occur to a “lesser degree” in the general population. There is a point when the behavior is not <i>normal</i>; it then qualifies as a disorder.
I do agree that everyone (especially children) has short attention spans. Some people are antisocial; it is part of their personality. Everyone, due to stress and fatigue, sometimes has <i>paranoid moments</i> or disordered thinking. I agree. 
What about the people whose <i>paranoid moments</i> are extreme to a point that it controls their lives? These people have delusions. Hence, they could start believing that others are conspiring against and mean to harm them. This type of thinking could lead to dangerous actions. Sometimes their disordered thinking prevents them from having a simple conversation with family and friends because no one understands them.
What about the people who are extremely antisocial? They tend to misbehave. All children misbehave though. Yes, but the difference between an autistic child and non-autistic child is for example the great challenge of comprehension and explaining to them that certain behaviors are not acceptable. They do not understand why. It is not people they are stupid. The most certainly are not. It is not because they are insolent little children whose parents did not raise them well. They are <i>incapable</i> of understanding certain things that most of us can.

66,./to_process\debate.show.A_proper_debate_for_the_existence_of_God_lj.xml,A proper debate for the existence of God,"This is a copy and paste argument I wrote quitesome time ago, it represents a creator God but not neccesarily an involved one.
(This is a response to an argument made by someone that God is not the creator of the universe, due to the Omniverse theory)
This particular topic was one which I had a really hard time with when I was not a believer as I could not find any other logical solution to this very issue, and as such I shall now expand upon that initial thought process which is more or less a more wordy form of the Cosmological argument.
Now to begin with we must first look at the issue of a single universe (ours). Now the idea is that there was no such thing as time before the big bang which of course makes sense, just as one could say that there are no timings before a race because the stopwatch has not been started yet. Now the issue I have with this is the fact that matter is a physical element and is thus subject to time and it would also need some method of creation, namely forces. So what we get is a situation where time is dependant on the matter to begin and vice versa. Then we also have the forces which are dependant themselves on matter to exist and the matter would need the extreme forces to exist (assuming that is how they are created according to the theory). So if we look at the analogy of the race we have a three way paradox in that the stopwatch cannot begin until all of the swimmers are at the blocks and the swimmers cannot get to the blocks because (in this case) there is no existence before the stopwatch begins. On top of this the starter’s gun cannot fire until all of the swimmers are at the blocks and at the ready and likewise the swimmers cannot start the race until the starters gun has fired. So what this means is that the swimmers would all have to be put into their positions all at the exact same time that the starter’s gun and the stopwatch go off. These both in terms of the analogy and reality are completely impossible.
There is however a theory known as the “pop” theory which more or less means that matter can pop into being from nothing aka has no cause. This is impossible on both logical and rational levels because matter, as a physical element, must have a cause. It would be like saying a table has no cause which is clearly nonsensical as it must be made before it can be a table. However on top of this there is no evidence to show that matter just appears out of nowhere. Also if matter just pops into existence without a cause then in reality there should be nothing that governs how or in what quantity it comes into being. Assuming this, then the moment the universe began it should have instantly filled up with new matter and thus the universe should be one infinite block of compact matter with no room for anti-matter etc. Now as a final point if pop theory is indeed true then if a physical element can pop into existence without cause then it would be likewise possible for a non-physical being to be uncaused.
Now what we call the universe is merely the perimeter with which matter is pushing it out, just as a balloon grows as the air molecules push against the sides of the balloon. We must assume that as matter does not exist outside of these universal “bubbles” that space is indeed a necessary property with which to create matter. In terms of our analogy space would be the pool. This adds another element to the issue in that the swimmers would need to be in the water already, but the pool needs to be filled with water by the swimmers. However the swimmers cannot fill the pool as time does not exist. So in other words they would need to fill the pool, be at the blocks and start the race all at the exact same time as the stopwatch is started and the starter’s gun goes off. If this point is argued against by saying that space is not dependant upon matter’s existence then the concept of an “Expanding universe” is illogical as the universe would already be infinite. As well as this the idea of an omniverse would also be impossible as it would all be one universe, just spaced apart like our galaxies are. 
Now to deal with the Omniverse theory itself. The basic idea is that the Omniverse is an infinite expanse of universes that can give birth to new universes. This is based on the idea of two universes “touching” each other, the force of which would initiate a big bang. Now the issue with this is that a universe cannot touch another universe if that other universe does not exist. As mentioned earlier the universe is dependant on the matter to exist and so on so forth. This means that a separate universe could not start another universe as there is no other universe to be started. In terms of the analogy think of the separate universe as being a helper who pushes you off of the blocks as you start to give you extra force, however they cannot push you off until the pool is filled. 
The only possibility then is if the other universe starts off another universe by fulfilling all of these factors meaning that it would have to split off from the main universe much like bacteria. The issue with this is that this is not a violent process and would not initiate a big bang as the matter is already within the space that has separated. But assuming that it did create a big bang then that particular universe would have to be immensely huge to be able to start a new universe with as much matter as ours. Another issue with this however is the problem that if it can split off then so should ours, and we should be creating more and more universes just as it would, meaning that eventually our universe would have petered out into nothing and we would essentially have in the end an omniverse full of single atoms. 
However the only way the Omniverse theory could be feasible as a creator is if it is infinite. Now this is impossible as matter can degenerate which means that on an infinite scale the omniverse should have either expanded out and eventually dissipated into nothingness or fallen back in upon itself due to gravitational pull and been destroyed (assuming there is gravitational pull between them which there shouldn’t be because the forces would be limited to the matter which are limited to the universe, just as a starter’s gun cannot be used to start a race the next town over). 
So as a result of the above statements we must conclude that there was indeed time before the big bang, just in another universe or dimension. Now these times themselves are dependant on the times of their creator universe, resulting in an infinite regression. However the Omniverse cannot be infinite due to the aforementioned points so eventually there must be a point of origin. This point of origin is in the exact same position as our universe, just several steps back and with nothing to appeal to.
This leaves us with only one rational option. That is that there is another separate universe/dimension that is not physical in nature (heaven) which was created by an uncaused entity that is also not physical in nature (God). This uncaused entity would have to be immensely powerful (Omnipotent) and not subject to physical laws such as time (Omnipresent). This being would thus be able to create space and matter at exactly the same time using its immense power (forces) and Omnipresence which in turn would start the universe.","""Your comments are as retarded as you are.

So anywho, with all due respect, here is my response to your argumentation:
<b>Definitions:</b>
The source for this definition is dictionary.senseagent.com 
<i>Apathy:</i>
Apatheism (a portmanteau of apathy and theism/atheism), also known as pragmatic or critically as practical atheism, is acting with apathy, disregard, or lack of interest towards belief, or lack of belief in a deity. 
<i>Defense of previous Definition</i>
My source was an avidly apatheistic individual, and his words were meant as an appraisal of apatheism. Therefore, being that this definition comes from one who has actual experience... his definition is still noteworthy.
<b>Negation of - Apatheism does not equal inability to empathize</b> 
You make a good point... but to my understanding (and please correct me if I'm wrong here) apatheism is in short atheism, just… without the ability or will to give answers like traditional atheism. Sooo what is the basis of apatheism? Is it a big IDK? Without any basis there is no real reason to say that apatheism leads to empathy of any kind, so I’d ask you to back this up or drop it. Religion in general gives the basis for morality and ethics: God and his rules/laws/guidelines (i.e. the ten commandments, the great commission… and these are just a couple from one religion out of a plethora of religions and moral and ethical guidelines/rules)
<b>Your not apathetic yet you emphasize apatheism?...</b>
Ok so you’re not apathetic... So are you’re an atheist then?
<b>Basis for my argumentation</b>
Well my basis is the bible and a number of other psychological and philosophical works 
<b> Answer to – “You've got little to no faith in the human condition, do you?”</b>
I believe that man is innately sinful… and without the grace of God is completely helpless against his sin nature which envelopes him… I have no faith in the human condition whatsoever… I have faith in God to save humanity from sin and impending death (eternal death).

I will repeat, existences can exist without evidence. In order to disprove an existence, you need evidence to disprove it. A lack or no evidence doesn't disprove the existence of an existence. 
Contradiction:

<b>You think you know who I am? You don't, and I'm fairly certain you never will.</b>
These two statements are contradictions. In the first statement of bolded words, you imply that this converstation proves your existence.

And the evidence that i do have for it, is all the physics problems that do show the existence of that value. But lets back track.

<b>Now that I have given the phrase the ridicule it so thoroughly deserves, I shall give it ""a wholesome answer"". </b>
Says the bloke who feigns to understand the complex while still struggling to understand the simple.
<b>Rather than address the issue, which is that monochromatic waveforms can be observed to move, and that their wavelengths are instantaneously identical, you have, to support your pseudoscientific hypothesis, decided to mutter some nonsense about the imprecision of my estimates.</b>
I find it funny that you act like an authority on what's scientific and whats pseudo-scientific, and don't seem to be able to tell the difference between informal argumentation and hypothesis! You side-step the fact that there is no steady source, and never mind the fact that the all the prerequisite conditions of these supposedly perfectly identical waveforms exist only theoretically, that no measurements have been ever made by anyone under such conditions, you nevertheless won't let that stop you from talking like they have.
<b>I have made no estimate; for I have made no attempt to quantify an instant. Indeed, as I hold an instant to be a circumstance in which time does not apply at all (being suspended), your argument is invalid. </b>
Now you suppose there are circumstances where time does not apply, how very scientific of you. Now I see why you hate time, it proves your ass wrong. Scientists are supposed to crave being proven wrong.
<b>The point, which it seems has eluded you (or, perhaps, which you have eluded), is that, notwithstanding the evolutions of time, the wavelengths within a ray of monochromatic light, instantaneously, within one medium, et cetera, are equal.</b>
So who has observed and made measurements of monochromatic light under such conditions. Fail to cite the research and it will be as if one of my arrows was a nuclear warhead.
<b>Or, to satisfy the corpuscular model, the energies of the photons within a ray of monochromatic light, are equal to one another.</b>
This still supposes conditions which are known to exist only hypothetically, and only speaks of what the theory <i>predicts</i> the measured results <i>would be</i> if there were such a thing as an isolated system.
<b>This is unscientific drivel. It equates to ""I have not yet measured a difference, but contrary to what I have observed, I shall believe a model which allows for them"".</b>
This is a crafty dodge on your part. I explained my point in simple terms that aren't field specific. I need not even address the quality of your counterargument, because I trust that anyone who reads them both will see which is the better formed statement. 
<b>The basis of your entire argument, is that ""imprecise instruments"" have measured differences between quantities which had been supposed to be equal.</b>
You really don't get it do you? The way that portion of my argument works is that the instruments we use to measure, however precise they may be, still only give us approximations. If equal is defined as without difference, we would need a perfectly precise way of measuring in order to verify the equality of two things. (be they monochromatic light waves or anything else)
I suppose I forgot to specifically mention that only theoretical light waves
1. pass through an unoccupied region of space
2. move unimpeded by interfering phenomena
3. emit simultaneously from a single source
I did mention however that non-imaginary light sources are in flux and then you backtracked and wanted to discuss the energy levels of orbiting electrons. You were even goofy enough to suggest that somehow this was a process ""which does not vary with time""...which seems kinda like your own flavor of ""unscientific drivel"" to me.
You went on to say:<b>It is known, that any two electrons, occupying the same energy level (and, if you like, the same orbital) must be imbued with identical energies for as long as they are so positioned.</b>, which seems to assume that they can't be ever so slightly out of balance, and merely have energy levels that are <i>not different enough</i> to immediately affect coherence. 
<b> I do not deny, that our instrumentation is imperfect, but I do demand that you hold yourself to the same standards to which you would have me adhere.</b>
Ok I promise not to presume that since I cannot yet measure a difference that there is no difference.
<b>No, sir, it was merely intended to dismiss a semantic argument which had not place in this dispute.</b>
Calling what you even admit to be multiple sources, a single source ala: <b>Obviously, a minute inspection reveals that there are in one source of light, immense numbers of individual sources</b> an out of place matter of semantics is just sidestepping the issue because you don't find it convenient.
<b>What evidence do you present, which suggests that the two are unequal?</b>
I, like you, am only arguing based on my interpretation of the evidence I've had access to.
You supposed equality under conditions that exist only theoretically. You did not bring to bear measurements made under laboratory conditions, because readings from laboratory instrumentation are sensitive enough to quantify variance. Even barring interference from the medium, there is still the issue of non-steady state of the source. Keep sidestepping it and I will keep putting it in your face.
<b>All of the evidence which does exist (most saliently, the predictability of ionic bonding, the neutrality of atoms, the decay of radioactive isotopes et alia), proves that the proton and electron have charges of equal magnitude.</b>
To the contrary, the evidence shows that decay due to imbalance (inequality) is everywhere.
<b>And I suppose no such thing.</b>
You certainly don't see it that way but anyone can tell by what's emboldened below that essentially you are.

One can say “ if I can see it ,then it exists”. We know this can’t always constitute a proof (for example, a mirage). 
One can say “if I can’t touch it or measure it, it does not exists”. Then, how do we prove the existence of intangible things like “charisma” and human emotions?
These things do exist (at least the vast majority of us human agree that they do). Yet the only real way that their existence is demonstrated is through their “tangible” effects, through analysis, statistics, deduction.
In fact, this is the way scientific discovery is made. The proof is reasonably achieved through the process of observing the effects, noting the correlations, the similarities, gathering statistics, note the negative impacts etc…

If you are not arguing that more written debaters source check than live debaters, then what exactly is the point you are trying to make? Great, some written debaters might source check. You have given no reason why that makes written debate superior. The only way written debate becomes superior through this assertion is that it is more common than in live debate, otherwise it is a non-unique benefit. My express point was that you have provided no basis for assuming source checking is more common with written than live debate.

My reference to my experience with debaters on this website was a direct response to your citing this forum as evidence to support your view. If the reference is inadequate, then that falls on you for attempting to use it initially. What you personally may do is also by no means a reflection of what others do, unless you give a reason as to why this would be true.
<b>it does in the qualified sense of experience that I was using which was ""an advantage for the audience with respect to argument verification"" (in reply to: easier does not necessarily make for a better debate or audience experience).</b>
You have ripped my argument out of context and disconnected it from its full analysis (i.e. the entire paragraph to follow). I go on to clearly explain why your unfounded assertion that argument verification cannot occur in live debate is fallacious. Further, your ""qualified sense of experience"" is itself entirely an assertion of preferentiality without any argument for its merit.
<b>That is not an argument that I made. (in reply to: breeding familiarity with key literature and research on a subject hardly seem like weaknesses to me.)</b>
Correct. It is an argument I was making, which you again removed from its overall context. My point was that live debate requires familiarity with literature and the subject, increasing the likelihood that the debaters use reliable information and are more capable of calling one another out instead of relying on an audience the majority of which never fact checks regardless of medium.
<b>no doubt, but my second proposition depends on there being greater ability to research a written debate, not a complete inability to research a live debate.</b>
Your second proposition depends upon more than greater ability, but establishing actual greater practice upon that ability. This is not something you have proven. My point in introducing the possibility of live fact checking was to counter your implication that it could not be done in live debate. In so doing, I have set a burden for you to demonstrate that since fact checking is possible in both mediums, that it actually occurs with greater frequency. If you cannot do this, then again you are incapable of demonstrating that written debate is objectively superior to live debate.
<b>Even if it raises flags, there is little that can be done about it in a live debate.</b>
Upon what basis to you make that assertion? As someone who has participated in live debates and who has actively called out my opponents on potentially illegitimate sources to great success, I heartily disagree. I have also seen other live debaters do this. It may require a certain skill set that written debate does not, but that hardly makes it impossible. To an at least equitable extent, not much can be done about it in a written debate either. You can call your opponent out on it, but if they deny or ignore this point there is little to no recourse.
<b>You are certainly free to point out other aspects of the audience experience.</b>
I see no reason to. You have won no ground upon the points at hand, let alone defeated me on them. By failing to demonstrate that written debate is objectively and demonstrably better at supporting source checking and argument verification, you have failed to prove the superiority of that medium to live debate.

This is a conflict of ideology, with no end in sight; nevertheless I shall persevere.

The characteristic behaviors of a spectrum disorder (like ADD, Autism, schizophrenia…) occur to a “lesser degree” in the general population. There is a point when the behavior is not <i>normal</i>; it then qualifies as a disorder.
I do agree that everyone (especially children) has short attention spans. Some people are antisocial; it is part of their personality. Everyone, due to stress and fatigue, sometimes has <i>paranoid moments</i> or disordered thinking. I agree. 
What about the people whose <i>paranoid moments</i> are extreme to a point that it controls their lives? These people have delusions. Hence, they could start believing that others are conspiring against and mean to harm them. This type of thinking could lead to dangerous actions. Sometimes their disordered thinking prevents them from having a simple conversation with family and friends because no one understands them.
What about the people who are extremely antisocial? They tend to misbehave. All children misbehave though. Yes, but the difference between an autistic child and non-autistic child is for example the great challenge of comprehension and explaining to them that certain behaviors are not acceptable. They do not understand why. It is not people they are stupid. The most certainly are not. It is not because they are insolent little children whose parents did not raise them well.

It had been accelerated in a cyclotron, stationed in that spaceship. Going in circles, increasing speed all the time. Then, just before the spaceships meet, the accelerating field stopped, and a hatch was opened to let the gun out, so it is moving in just the right direction, which is opposite to the ship's direction.
It can rip a hole in the ship for all we care, since the astronaut is dead. But it can also be caught in a magnetic field, and redirected to enter the same cyclotron.
These are all technical issues.
<b>The gun starts accelerating when T is 0, since that is the start of gun time, right? Well, that means that T' can never be negative. That means that the gun can't go back in time and shoot the guy before he started the accelerator</b>
T' is not negative. OK, let's say the gun starts accelerating, when the astronaut is born. The accelerator is programmed to stop say when the guy is 15, unless he flicks a special switch, which he does. Everything else is the same. We have T' as being say 1 day, when T is 20 years. Being 20 years, the guy is shot by the gun as a 1 day-old, thus preventing himself from flicking that switch, and the gun shooting him.
<i>But this can be made even easier</i>:
Lets say both astronauts get out of their ships just before they meet, wearing spacesuits.
One of them shoots in the direction of the other spaceship, aiming at a point where the other astronaut's head would be, if he were 20. In the first one's reference frame, the second one is just 1 day old, and he misses him. However, in the second one's reference frame, he is 20 years old, so he gets hit by the laser, and dies.
So, the second astronaut is both dead and alive, depending on reference frame.
Supposing the ships decelerate, and then turn around and meet each other. When the first astronaut gets into the second ship, will the second one be alive, or dead?

First of all, I want you to be aware of my position concerning the debate of the theory of evolution. There are many evidences of many things in life. And that which one person infers as evidence of one thing is not necessarily and universally evidence of the same unto another person. Moreover, that which you have written of as evidence of evolution I find to be unconvincing. And likewise that, which I have written of I perceive is also unconvincing unto you. I am not interested in dissuading your position in regards to your conclusions. I am more interested in challenging what I think is axiomatic concerning the progenitors of the members of a species.
Axiom: a conclusion that needs no proof because its truth is obvious. (As used in Logic)
My axiom, simplified, is that a progenitor propagates progeny of its own species. Or one could also say that each species propagates its own species.
The definitions of the terms of my propositional axiom do not connote meanings that are specially defined. Example: Species A begets offspring of Species A. Man is born of man. Oranges are the fruit of Orange trees, etc.
What is your axiom? 
Our debate has now effectively been reduced to two conclusions; one is yours and the other mine. We can actually spare one another thousands of words of explanations by simply determining the root cause of our disagreement, so called. Take for example the following argument.
My argument: A is B, and B is D, therefore A is D. 
Your argument: A is not B, B is not D, and therfore A is not D. 
We can agree or disagree based upon the axiom. And the debate logically ends or begins thereby.

If you are not arguing that more written debaters source check than live debaters, then what exactly is the point you are trying to make? Great, some written debaters might source check. You have given no reason why that makes written debate superior. The only way written debate becomes superior through this assertion is that it is more common than in live debate, otherwise it is a non-unique benefit. My express point was that you have provided no basis for assuming source checking is more common with written than live debate.
<b>This could also be true of live debates, but would only be known through investigation. It also does not rebut the first claim. I personally check other people's sources nearly always and always check my own sources before using them.</b>
My reference to my experience with debaters on this website was a direct response to your citing this forum as evidence to support your view. If the reference is inadequate, then that falls on you for attempting to use it initially. What you personally may do is also by no means a reflection of what others do, unless you give a reason as to why this would be true.
<b>it does in the qualified sense of experience that I was using which was ""an advantage for the audience with respect to argument verification"" (in reply to: easier does not necessarily make for a better debate or audience experience).</b>
You have ripped my argument out of context and disconnected it from its full analysis (i.e. the entire paragraph to follow). I go on to clearly explain why your unfounded assertion that argument verification cannot occur in live debate is fallacious. Further, your ""qualified sense of experience"" is itself entirely an assertion of preferentiality without any argument for its merit.
<b>That is not an argument that I made. (in reply to: breeding familiarity with key literature and research on a subject hardly seem like weaknesses to me.)</b>
Correct. It is an argument I was making, which you again removed from its overall context. My point was that live debate requires familiarity with literature and the subject, increasing the likelihood that the debaters use reliable information and are more capable of calling one another out instead of relying on an audience the majority of which never fact checks regardless of medium.
<b>no doubt, but my second proposition depends on there being greater ability to research a written debate, not a complete inability to research a live debate.</b>
Your second proposition depends upon more than greater ability, but establishing actual greater practice upon that ability. This is not something you have proven. My point in introducing the possibility of live fact checking was to counter your implication that it could not be done in live debate. In so doing, I have set a burden for you to demonstrate that since fact checking is possible in both mediums, that it actually occurs with greater frequency. If you cannot do this, then again you are incapable of demonstrating that written debate is objectively superior to live debate.
<b>Even if it raises flags, there is little that can be done about it in a live debate.</b>
Upon what basis to you make that assertion? As someone who has participated in live debates and who has actively called out my opponents on potentially illegitimate sources to great success, I heartily disagree. I have also seen other live debaters do this. It may require a certain skill set that written debate does not, but that hardly makes it impossible. To an at least equitable extent, not much can be done about it in a written debate either. You can call your opponent out on it, but if they deny or ignore this point there is little to no recourse.
<b>You are certainly free to point out other aspects of the audience experience.</b>
I see no reason to. You have won no ground upon the points at hand, let alone defeated me on them. By failing to demonstrate that written debate is objectively and demonstrably better at supporting source checking and argument verification, you have failed to prove the superiority of that medium to live debate. I have given you an analysis as to why live debate is capable of source checking and argument verification, even advancing an analysis as to why we might suspect this to occur among the debaters themselves with greater frequency. I have pointed out that source checking is not demonstrably prevalent in either medium, making individual debater accountability wholly relevant.

I contend that they frequently don't - my evidence also being this site. The number of times I have checked someone's sources and found them to be terribly illegitimate, fallacious, or grossly misrepresented far exceeds that of when the source is credible. I have also only very rarely encountered anyone who has checked my own sources. Given that the majority of debaters themselves are not checking their own sources or those of their opponent, I think it is a very safe conclusion that very, very few observers ever check even some of the sources being cited. There is absolutely no basis to claim that more observers of written debate source check than those observing a live debate, particularly given the prevalence of smart phones for live fact checking.
<i>Second Proposition</i>
Regarding your second proposition, easier does not necessarily make for a better debate or audience experience. The delay in exchanges arguably discourages the following of written debates to begin with, and the more an individual debater is actually gathering appropriate evidence the longer that debate is going to be protracted. By contrast, a live debate has immediate responses. The debaters largely do rely upon their memory; exercising and training recall, and breeding familiarity with key literature and research on a subject hardly seem like weaknesses to me. That live debate requires more effort is strongly indicative of a <i>better</i> debate for the audience and debaters, not a lesser one. 
Further, there is some capacity for live fact checking and research, again via smart phone technology. There is no reason that a wholly illegitimate source should fly under the radar, particularly as a well-researched debater will be familiar with the legitimate sources and a strange source should raise automatic flags. Lacking such live fact checking, it is entirely possible for a debater to include in their counter a note/flag for their audience that the source may not be legitimate and to challenge their opponent to elaborate upon the source further.","""You need help.

It had been accelerated in a cyclotron, stationed in that spaceship. Going in circles, increasing speed all the time. Then, just before the spaceships meet, the accelerating field stopped, and a hatch was opened to let the gun out, so it is moving in just the right direction, which is opposite to the ship's direction.
It can rip a hole in the ship for all we care, since the astronaut is dead. But it can also be caught in a magnetic field, and redirected to enter the same cyclotron.
These are all technical issues.
<b>The gun starts accelerating when T is 0, since that is the start of gun time, right? Well, that means that T' can never be negative. That means that the gun can't go back in time and shoot the guy before he started the accelerator</b>
T' is not negative. OK, let's say the gun starts accelerating, when the astronaut is born. The accelerator is programmed to stop say when the guy is 15, unless he flicks a special switch, which he does. Everything else is the same. We have T' as being say 1 day, when T is 20 years. Being 20 years, the guy is shot by the gun as a 1 day-old, thus preventing himself from flicking that switch, and the gun shooting him.
<i>But this can be made even easier</i>:
Lets say both astronauts get out of their ships just before they meet, wearing spacesuits.
One of them shoots in the direction of the other spaceship, aiming at a point where the other astronaut's head would be, if he were 20. In the first one's reference frame, the second one is just 1 day old, and he misses him. However, in the second one's reference frame, he is 20 years old, so he gets hit by the laser, and dies.
So, the second astronaut is both dead and alive, depending on reference frame.
Supposing the ships decelerate, and then turn around and meet each other. When the first astronaut gets into the second ship, will the second one be alive, or dead?

132,./to_process\debate.show.Are_live_debates_are_superior_to_written_debates_lj.xml,Are live debates superior to written debates?,"<b>First Proposition</b>
Your initial first proposition was only ""that there is at least some drive to check sources - i'll offer this site or any other written debate site as evidence."" My arguments pertaining to the prevalence of drive were in direct response to that, including my counter example of this forum. Do not insult my integrity on account of your ineptitude in defending your initial assertion. 
You now contend not that written debate is characterized by “some drive to check sources”, but that the drive is comparable for both mediums (a claim you justify not with any actual warrant but in the name of simplicity, but which I shall call either laziness or inability) and that it is the ability to exercise that drive which matters. This is a new argument under the first proposition, and far more closely related to the second where I will henceforth address it.
<b>Second Proposition</b>
Your second proposition has been that it is easier to be more thorough in fact/source/argument checking a written debate. This is an argument of ability. I group your modified observations off of the first proposition here, since they are now effectively the same argument.
You contend that because written debate occurs at the pace of the participants this makes them more able to fact/source/argument check. You have furnished no proof that the pace of a written debate compliments that of its observers. I contend that observers are perfectly capable of live debate source checking, and further note that most live debates are officially recorded (and all may be recorded by the observer) for later review. Further, I contend that in written debate the delay between responses actually discourages continued observance of the debate altogether; it is too <i>slow</i>. You end up with no external source or fact checking because you have no observers (or at the very best, far fewer). As mentioned previously, this is paired with a diminished capacity for internal fact and source checking due to the debaters' lesser familiarity with the subject in written debate.
You have additionally contended that: <i>In my experience the success of live examination depends highly on the material being debated (and, of course, the skill of the debaters.)& I think here is where we may have a genuine point of disagreement. In a written debate, the other party can request the source, examine it, and respond accordingly.</i>
The success of written examination depends highly on the material and skill of the debaters as well; no one is going to endure a protracted written debate or critically examine it if they are unfamiliar with the material, if the material is poorly presented, or the debaters inept. This is non-unique, and also a non-response to my point that debaters can call themselves out on sources at least as much as in written debate. For instance, in a live debate, the other party can also request the source, examine it, and respond accordingly. That is non-unique. What is different is that there is more pressure in a live debate to actually share the source, and less capacity to backtrack if caught off-guard when using illegitimate sources. Accountability is higher in live debate.
<i><b>Regarding the weighing criteria for this debate</b></i>
<b>Qualified Sense of Experience [and] “I have said twice now […] I do not believe it possible to say that either format is objectively better at all times and for all participants.”</b>
And as I have already said, this is a misrepresentation of my argument entirely. My point was that your “qualified sense of experience” assumes a number of things: (1) that ease of observance is a legitimate concern and criteria for assessing superiority of medium; and (2) that you have consistently assumed that your own preferences and abilities are reflective of the majority of observers in most circumstances.
The question is not one of universal superiority, but of probabilistic superiority. My arguments against the qualified sense of experience are that your standards for assessing that probable superiority are themselves potentially invalid assumptions; therefore unless you demonstrate their validity as criteria even winning an argument on them has no weight.","""you're an idiot.

Okay...
<b>And who cares about 'holy' or 'pre-ordained' or 'divine'- you are blaming a living being and prosecuting for something out of its control. That is such an injustice. </b>

If that point is not magic than there is no reason that thing should be treated special. The only measure left is self-awareness and feeling. Therefore abortion to the point it is currently legal is more than ample to make sure nothing is harmed.

Basically, yes. I think you have to. I believe that, in order for something to exist, it must be subject to the nature of existence. Existence behaves a certain way, and anything that can be said to exist is subject to this behavior. Axioms such as the Law of Identity are ways we describe this behavior, and serve as a basis for logic. 
If something is not subject to these ""laws of existence,"" or ""laws of reality,"" then I don't think it can be said to exist, as it's not meeting the requirements of existence. Obviously, since theists want to show that God exists, they must allow for God to be subject the nature of what it is to exist. Thus, God cannot create or do things that are not consistent with the nature of existence.
This is why the simplest definition of omnipotence, ""X can do everything,"" isn't valid. It doesn't exclude things that are logically impossible. 
So, the definition changes to ""X can do everything that is logically possible to do."" This is still a problem though, because God is not just limited to the laws of existence. God is limited (mostly) to his moral nature as presented in the Bible. God cannot lie, God cannot commit an immoral act, etc. This means there are some things that are logically possible but not possible for a being with God's traditional properties.
So, the definition changes again. ""X can do everything that is logically possible for a being with X's defining properties."" This is the definition I was running with here, so the problem is obvious. Once you allow omnipotence to be relativised to a set of properties, it opens up the possibility for multiple omnipotent beings. You could have a being whose defining property is the inability to do anything, and it would be compatible with this definition of omnipotence.
The definition can evolve further, stating that ""X can do everything that is logically possible for a being with X's defining properties to do; and there is no being conceivable with greater powers than X."" But this definition runs into the same problem as the second. There are logically possible things God cannot do due to His being morally perfect. A being could be conceived that is like God, but isn't morally perfect. This being could do everything God could, as well as perform morally evil acts.

Your initial first proposition was only ""that there is at least some drive to check sources - i'll offer this site or any other written debate site as evidence."" My arguments pertaining to the prevalence of drive were in direct response to that, including my counter example of this forum. Do not insult my integrity on account of your ineptitude in defending your initial assertion. 
You now contend not that written debate is characterized by “some drive to check sources”, but that the drive is comparable for both mediums (a claim you justify not with any actual warrant but in the name of simplicity, but which I shall call either laziness or inability) and that it is the ability to exercise that drive which matters. This is a new argument under the first proposition, and far more closely related to the second where I will henceforth address it.
<b>Second Proposition</b>
Your second proposition has been that it is easier to be more thorough in fact/source/argument checking a written debate. This is an argument of ability. I group your modified observations off of the first proposition here, since they are now effectively the same argument.
You contend that because written debate occurs at the pace of the participants this makes them more able to fact/source/argument check. You have furnished no proof that the pace of a written debate compliments that of its observers. I contend that observers are perfectly capable of live debate source checking, and further note that most live debates are officially recorded (and all may be recorded by the observer) for later review. Further, I contend that in written debate the delay between responses actually discourages continued observance of the debate altogether; it is too <i>slow</i>. You end up with no external source or fact checking because you have no observers (or at the very best, far fewer). As mentioned previously, this is paired with a diminished capacity for internal fact and source checking due to the debaters' lesser familiarity with the subject in written debate.
You have additionally contended that: <i>In my experience the success of live examination depends highly on the material being debated (and, of course, the skill of the debaters.)& I think here is where we may have a genuine point of disagreement. In a written debate, the other party can request the source, examine it, and respond accordingly.</i>
The success of written examination depends highly on the material and skill of the debaters as well; no one is going to endure a protracted written debate or critically examine it if they are unfamiliar with the material, if the material is poorly presented, or the debaters inept. This is non-unique, and also a non-response to my point that debaters can call themselves out on sources at least as much as in written debate. For instance, in a live debate, the other party can also request the source, examine it, and respond accordingly. That is non-unique. What is different is that there is more pressure in a live debate to actually share the source, and less capacity to backtrack if caught off-guard when using illegitimate sources. Accountability is higher in live debate.
<i><b>Regarding the weighing criteria for this debate</b></i>
<b>Qualified Sense of Experience [and] “I have said twice now […] I do not believe it possible to say that either format is objectively better at all times and for all participants.”</b>
And as I have already said, this is a misrepresentation of my argument entirely. My point was that your “qualified sense of experience” assumes a number of things: (1) that ease of observance is a legitimate concern and criteria for assessing superiority of medium; and (2) that you have consistently assumed that your own preferences and abilities are reflective of the majority of observers in most circumstances.
The question is not one of universal superiority, but of probabilistic superiority. My arguments against the qualified sense of experience are that your standards for assessing that probable superiority are themselves potentially invalid assumptions; therefore unless you demonstrate their validity as criteria even winning an argument on them has no weight.","""you are stupid""",1.0

<a href='http://lisacruz2.tripod.com/id30.html'>According to biology</a>, the characteristics of living creatures are as follows
<i>1. Living things are highly organized, from the smallest part to the largest.
2. All living things have an ability to acquire materials and energy.
3. All living things have an ability to respond to their environment.
4. All living things have an ability to reproduce.
5. All living things have an ability to adapt.</i>
Right at the very moment the sperm makes contact with the egg, the egg starts to act independently, It starts to organize, it quickly leans how to acquire nutrition and use it, it knows how to respond to their environment and knows how to adapt to it. It even knows how to reproduce by dividing its cells over and over.
An ordinary Egg and Sperm cannot do any of this. Which concludes that Life starts at conception.

The fate of her fetus is not the business of anyone except her and her doctor. 
2: A fetus is not a human being, meaning terminating a pregnancy is not murder. For evidence of this consider whether a first or second trimester fetus could live on its own, without the asistance of the mother or medical technology. Also consider that the bible does not consider fetuses legal human beings (Exodus 21:22-25), so there is no religious argument supporting the pro life position. 
3: People should not be punished for birth control failing, for being uninformed about how babies are made or for general immaturity. A baby is an extremely expensive thing, if two parents were unprepared financially or lack the maturity necessary to raise a child in modern times then a pregnancy could ruin the lives of not only the parents but of the child as well. 
4: An unplanned pregnancy can have negative consequences not only for the mother, father and child, but also for the society they are a part of. If this family was not financially able to raise a child, the public ends up paying for them through welfare programs, etc... I would rather see my tax dollars go to more productive causes. 
5: If abortion were illegal and considered murder then the mother who had the abortion would have to be prosecuted for first degree murder.

In a forced marriage the man and woman are not allowed to speak until after the wedding day. I call both types d'aranged anyway. In an arranged marriage whether the man and the woman get to meet and determine whether or not they like each other there is still a ton of pressure from their parents.

I guess if you live with someone long enough and have children with them, then you grow to love them. But it may not be the same type of love you would have had if you decided on your own. It may not be as intense or as happy. Its just being fake and going through the motions. It's doing what your parents want you to do. And sure they choose someone with the same religion, morals and values but where is the fun is being the same? If they are in America, isn't it exciting to learn about other religions?

49,debates\debate.show.Asian_American_for_a_President_of_the_United_States_of_America_in_21st_Century_lj.xml,Asian-American for a President of the United States of America in 21st Century,"My personal theory is that, culturally, Asians are more studious than personable. Perhaps the most important aspect of getting elected to public office is your personality. At current time, most Asian-Americans still have family members who are very adamant that the family remains traditional. As time goes by, those older generations will die out, and the younger generations will be well educated and very social.
There are many Asian-American officials here in California, and specifically the Bay Area.","In theory the presidency should not be about the race of the candidate, so if an Asian American comes up with good ideas and has the charisma to win people over then it will happen.
In practice, I don't see it happening for a few reasons.
The Asian community has not established its presence in America with confidence. They have not fought the same battles as the black community. When the black community was shouting through their lungs that they wanted to be called American, the Asian community remained passive. In a way, they have been shadowed by the voice of the black community. So, in the public psyche, there is black and white Americans, everybody else is either a visitor or a bystander.
Culturally, the Asian community has kept itself to itself. Most businesses are run by families and they usually revolve around an Asian theme (Chinese or Indian restaurants and bars etc). Their traditions have not been made entirely public, and by that I mean that they have not filtered into the main stream. They remain in Chinatown. Even artistically they are not in the main stream. How many mega stars do you know that are Asian? And how many of those stars are involved in art that is not Asian-themed? 
This brings me to the next point. 
Up until a couple of decades ago, America was seen as a predominantly white country. If you look at the pictures taken of workers that built the Hoover Dam and the whole of New York, you'll see that they are all Caucasian white. However, we do know that there were thousands of Asian and black workers there. They were just not allowed to be in the pictures. Because the image of America was to remain ""white"". That image still hasn't gone away. It is true that people really enjoy seeing ethnic minorities on TV. But the key word is SEEING. Not HEARING them... For any minority to become accepted in the main stream there is an un-written rule that they have to sound like white people. Which is why all ethnic news-people learn to talk more white. It hides their ethnic origins. Think Oprah, think Obama. Any bit of accent has to be ironed out. Unfortunately, it is very hard for Asian people to sound neutral or un-accented. The ones that manage it, have more of a chance to go far. Look at that Asian chick in Oprah, there is nothing Asian in her accent.
My last point is about ""associated country"". When white people look at black people, there isn't a particular country that comes to mind. Some may call them African-American but Africa is a whole continent. So once you go past the color difference, its not hard to accept them as American. But when it comes to Asian people you have two very large and distinctive nations in mind. China and India. So Chinese people are seen as ""citizens of China"" that happen to be in America. The same goes for Indian people and India. The look is so distinctive that it's very hard for a nation that perceives itself as ""origin-free"" to accept someone that ""represents"" another country. Especially when that other country is a potential threat to your country or when that other country represents Communism... It's not easy.
It's actually harder for Asian people to be thought of as American than it was for black people. At least black people fought the battle. Asians haven't.

There are other ways to build character and this is one way that shoudl not be allowed.","Reading all these counterarguments on how/why bullying is ""so horrible"" and how it ""leads to premature deaths/suicides"" really makes me disgusted in my generation.
Bullying is NOT bad. Nor has it ever been. The only reason that it has gotten as 'bad' as it is nowadays is because we, as a society, continue fueling the fire of this idea by forbidding it by law and such; we are giving those few children who do, quote on quote 'bully', the drive to rebel and commit the problems that we are trying to avoid.
Back when our parents were younger, there were no rules against calling someone fat or shoving them into a locker; back in the 1900's, our parents, grandparents, and so on, had to deal with these troublemakers THEMSELVES; there was absolutely ZERO money spent on having a 'bullying counselor' to go to with your predicament and tears. Though, what did they do without these therapists? They dealt with it all themselves; and look at how normal they've turned out now. 
Dealing with bullies can, as stated, build character but ALSO mature the 'victim.' As a 'victim' of bullying, one has to learn to suck it up and say something as well as not be afraid to stand up for themselves and show the troublemaker who's boss. As a 'victim' of bullying, one learns how to fend for themselves and how to fight back against their critics. 
Once our generation grows up and graduates from school with this, somewhat, security blanket that 'everyone loves everyone' and 'bullying no longer exist', as soon as they enter the real world, reality is going to be a bitch. Because, regardless of whether you're a freshman in highschool or some high-up doctor of 6 years, there will always be those few son-of-a-guns that lie, cheat, and BULLY you. 
YOU CAN NOT ESCAPE BULLYING NO MATTER WHAT SOCIAL STANDING YOU ARE IN. NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO LOVE YOU IN LIFE, THUS, RESULTING IN THEM BACKFIRING AGAINST YOU AND CAUSING YOU UNNEDEED TROUBLE. SURE, IT IS UNFAIR BUT THAT'S LIFE. 
Although I disagree with the whole 'bullying should be encouraged', I do agree with the fact that it should NOT be avoided, nor should it be prevented; bullying is a nature experience that every human being will EVENTUALLY have to endure at some point during their life. So, why wouldn't we prepare our generation young and teach them how to self defend as well as be their own person and not take ANYBODY'S crap, no matter how low their self-esteem is or how 'shy' they feel about speaking up. Because, at the end of the day, when these kids gets jobs, there's no 'bullying counselor' that they can run to anymore.

The only exception should be for murder, rape, and treason those are very serious and in my opinion are unforgivable.","This is crap. To forgive someone for something is a ""personal"" thing. How can someone have to find the effort to forgive a kidnapper who kidnapped some random child 3,000 miles away when it, seriously, has nothing to do with the person personally? It's a sad thing that should've never happened, but I don't get it. Does society really feel that compelled to shove themselves into the feet of victims to act like they, them self, are the victim? Instead of even bothering to get into the criminal's shoes? Bottom line, to forgive someone is a personal thing, and it's NEVER a mandatory thing. In fact, in the suggestion of sexual abuse victims, they are suggested that forgiving their abuser is their choice, but not mandatory, nor necessary. What matters is the ability to MOVE ON and not let something bad ruin the rest of your life. Therefore, a man's contributions to society have nothing to do with the ability to forgive him for anything. A contributer is just one good aspect of him; His crime is just one bad aspect of him.

It isn't hard though but if you can't you need some help before someone gets hurt.,"Not really.
Most people, in fact, cannot control their temper.
It's more of an evolutionary trait than of any weak of will or whatever.
But irrational explosions of emotion are common among humans. Clearly we are not very perfectly wired. However, this doesn't exactly mean that getting angry is irrational. In fact, not getting angry can, at times, be irrational. The purpose of anger is as a defense mechanism. Like most mechanisms that our brain employs, we don't use them appropriately. We use them, instead, when we feel that situation calls for it. We are self-aware, free thinking individuals. There are plenty of times when we will feel that doing something is right, even if days later it comes to us that it was wrong. This is why it's better to wait a few days before engaging with someone (or even making a life-changing decision) when you're very upset.
So if you've never gotten openly angry at someone (like yell at them or insult them harshly) it's very possible that you are also not using your mechanisms appropriately. In your case, it would that thing called keeping calm, which is appropriate for keeping your decisions rational, but it can also just be out of fear of reaction or belief that not expressing your emotions would benefit you better.
I find it that I don't like to deal with people. I don't really try to express any other dominance than intellect. This could be a problem because most people don't give a shit about intellect. If I merely yelled louder and tried to be more intimidating, I'd probably get what I want more. However, my issues are that I control my temper far too often, and sometimes try to divert negative energy through humor (which can work for many, but not all).

In one era one genre prevailed, in second other party of musical expression towered. The past is not worse and it is not better, simple because it is absolute another. It pursued other aims, used other means, eventually, it had other audience! And here so it is simply impossible to hang up a terrible, huge, bulky and clumsy label ""Better"". This my IMHO, but music and cars are different things. Music - art, cars - something from industry area. The church in California is a church, and the shopping center like Empire S.B. is a building with commercial purposes, aren't they? It's out of my league - to compare such kind of things.

129,debates\debate.show.Can_we_agree_music_is_objectively_improving_over_time_lj.xml,Can we agree music is objectively improving over time?,"The techniques themselves are all great throughout the ages, but as time goes on there has arisen more diversity between music, which is always an improvement.","I don't think so. Your examples, especially the car one, are about advancements in technique of making something. Yes, techniques of recording music have advanced; but good music isn't about technology. Take auto tune,...please. (if you didn't get that you can stop reading now) 
Music is about conveying emotion/feeling, much like poetry. Would you say poetry has gotten objectively better? No, it depends on the personal writer's ability to express their self in a way that speaks to the reader. Same with music.
I truly believe 'Video killed the radio star'. 
MTV caused the popularity of a musician to include how they looked, instead of just how they sounded. Would Janice Joplin have been as popular as she was had she been on MTV. (nothing but love to Janice, she could sing, but she was not TV friendly) 
The next nail was the increased commercialization of music. 
Why make a soulful ballad of emotional expression, when a simple catchy beat makes you more money?
The politics of getting any radio air time assures needing a major record label. So if you make music that isn't made for the lowest common denominator, aka, bound to be in the top forty it is very hard to be picked up by a major label, so nobody hears your music. 
Music hasn't objective improved because it can't because it is about personal expression.

I think people in America and states like this are too irresponsible. We all cave in to the idea that we can have what we want if we work for it (or not?). 
 Just as Rousseau explains in *""The Social Contract and the Origin of Inequality"", impulse of appetite is slavery condemning one, especially in this case, to serve your own cravings (for things) by working to have them. 
It's completely absurd, to have a society making and selling things for the sake of having them. What I mean is, look at how many things are being sold that are not needed by everyone.
Who is working to build them for their wages? Who is buying them? Do you think people working at some sweat shop (not to be taken literally), would rather be paid in what they assemble than cash that can be spent on things that they too, do not need by necessity?
 This is how the old world economy functioned, and it worked well until we figured out how to mass produce things. If you were a farmer, you would take your earnings down to a market, trade and barter... Coins held value naturally, without a banking system, so that if you needed something, you could trade the metal for something that you needed, and it was universally excepted because the metal alone had value.
 Capitalism is a cheap trick, and will fail shortly. We can already see it buckling now, with fuel prices rising, food prices rising, the cost of living, rising.

Why has evolution elevated human intelligence so high that we can send satallites and pathfinders to Mars but yet other species aren't even smart enough to make fire yet? What i don't want to hear from anyone is the typical 'Oh it takes 37 billion years' reply. During the industrial revolution your precious evolution allowed moths to change color because the soot on the trees were not allowing them to camouflage themselves from preditors, so their wings turned black. Darwin's finches evolved very quickly also to deal with the surface of the ground. So why is the evolution of intelligence so one sided? Humans are responsible for the extinction of many species but yet evolution refuses to upgrade the intelligence of other life forms to protect themselves from our wrath. Why so one sided? Does intelligence not evolve for anyone but humans? Coming from your own mouths we were all dumb apes years ago, what is evolution waiting for, why can't I play chess with a horse yet? We're tearing down the Amazon yet evolution hasn't equiped those species with the intelligence to fight back. Why?","OK I think some things need to be put straight. Firstly, creationism is pure ignorance of truth and fact, we know beyond doubt (and not just beyond reasonable doubt, beyond any doubt) that the world isn't 10, 000 years old and that we weren't all created, as we are, by 'God' in seven days. Radioactive decay is proof that the earth is well over 4 billion years old.
Secondly, evolution has been proved beyond any reasonable doubt, it is no longer a theory, it is scientifically accepted fact, there may still be a small amount of ambiguity as to whether 'survival of the fittest' is the driving force behind evolution, but none as to whether evolution is the driving force behind life - to deny just proves you really don't understand what your talking about.
Thirdly, most any argument as to why there 'must' be a god is usually circular logic; IE. 'there must be a God because the cosmos is so complex that it had to have been the product of a conscious mind' - by that logic then God itself must be infinitely more complex, and therefore must have been created by a greater 'God', and so on ad infinite. Those are arguments of logic, other arguments are just bred through pure ignorance and aren't even worth combating.
In summary; evolution is fact, creationism is based on an archaic system of beliefs that existed literally millenia before we had any reason to believe otherwise. The big bang theory is just that, a theory - no one is suggesting that is fact (if they are then again they don't know of what they speak). It makes sense because all the things we see in the cosmos coincide with the idea; IE. red/blue shift of galaxies, radiation decay etc. These things follow the theory of what we call 'the big bang' and there is no hard evidence to disprove it - however science, unlike religion, recognizes that it doesn't know everything and that certain things may be proved false in the future, the big bang is a theory and may be replaced by another when we have garnered more knowledge.
However it is completely irrational to attribute everything we don't know yet to God. Hundreds of years ago we didn't know what caused wind, waves or fire - so we reasoned that it must be a great god - now we know better but we still aren't advanced enough to answer all our questions, so we say that anything we don't yet have an answer for must have been God - unacceptable in this day and age if you ask me.",3.0
